      locationIntro: "For individuals in Moreno Valley facing persecution in their home country but unable to meet the strict requirements for asylum, Withholding of Removal offers an alternative form of protection. While it provides fewer benefits than asylum, it can prevent deportation to a country where you would face serious harm. SoCal Immigration Services helps Inland Empire residents understand and pursue all available forms of humanitarian protection.",

      answerCapsule: "Withholding of Removal is a form of immigration relief that prevents the U.S. government from deporting you to a specific country where you would more likely than not face persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Unlike asylum, there is no one-year filing deadline, but it provides fewer benefits. Call SoCal Immigration Services at (714) 421-8872 for a consultation about your protection options.",

It is governed by Section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- Prevents deportation to a specific country\n- Based on persecution grounds similar to asylum\n- Higher standard of proof than asylum (more likely than not vs. well-founded fear)\n- No one-year filing deadline like asylum\n- Mandatory protection if standard is met (not discretionary)\n\n**Important Distinctions:**\nUnlike asylum, which is a discretionary form of relief that the immigration judge can grant or deny based on various factors, Withholding of Removal is mandatory. If you prove you meet the legal standard, the judge must grant it.\n\nHowever, Withholding of Removal does not provide a path to permanent residency or citizenship. It simply protects you from being sent back to the specific country where you face persecution.",

        {
          q: "What is the difference between asylum and Withholding of Removal?",
          a: "The main differences are: (1) Standard of proof - withholding requires showing it's more likely than not you'll be persecuted (over 50%), while asylum only requires a well-founded fear (as low as 10%); (2) Withholding has no one-year deadline while asylum must be filed within one year of arrival; (3) Asylum can lead to a green card, but withholding cannot; (4) Asylum is discretionary, but withholding is mandatory if you meet the standard."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I apply for Withholding of Removal if I missed the one-year asylum deadline?",
          a: "Yes! This is one of the main reasons people pursue Withholding of Removal. Unlike asylum, there is no filing deadline for Withholding of Removal. If you missed the one-year deadline for asylum and don't qualify for an exception, you can still apply for Withholding of Removal if you face persecution in your home country."
        },
        {
          q: "Does Withholding of Removal give me a green card?",
          a: "No. Withholding of Removal does not provide a path to permanent residency (green card) or citizenship. It only prevents the government from deporting you to the specific country where you face persecution. You would need to find another way to obtain a green card, such as through family or employment."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my family be included in my Withholding of Removal case?",
          a: "Unlike asylum, Withholding of Removal does not provide derivative status for family members. Each family member who fears persecution must file their own application and prove their own case. This is an important difference from asylum, which allows you to include your spouse and unmarried children under 21."
        },
        {
          q: "What is CAT protection and how is it different?",
          a: "CAT (Convention Against Torture) protection prevents deportation to a country where you would face torture. Unlike Withholding of Removal, CAT does not require showing persecution based on a protected ground (race, religion, etc.). You must show it's more likely than not you would be tortured with the involvement or acquiescence of a government official."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I work with Withholding of Removal status?",
          a: "Yes. If you are granted Withholding of Removal, you can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) that allows you to work legally in the United States. You will need to renew this work permit periodically."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I travel outside the United States with Withholding of Removal?",
          a: "Travel is very restricted with Withholding of Removal status. Unlike asylees who can get a refugee travel document, those with withholding generally cannot travel internationally without risking their status. If you return to your country of persecution, you may be found to have abandoned your fear of persecution."
        },
        {
          q: "What crimes bar me from Withholding of Removal?",
          a: "You can be barred from Withholding of Removal if you have been convicted of a particularly serious crime, which includes aggravated felonies. You can also be barred if you persecuted others, committed serious nonpolitical crimes outside the U.S., or are considered a danger to U.S. security. However, even if barred from withholding, you may still qualify for CAT deferral."
