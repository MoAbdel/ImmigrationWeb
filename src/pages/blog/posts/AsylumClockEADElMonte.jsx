          heading: "What is the Asylum Clock?",
          content: "The asylum clock is an internal USCIS tracking system that counts the number of days your asylum application has been pending. This clock directly determines your eligibility for work authorization under the 180-day rule established by federal regulations.\n\nThe asylum clock starts running on the date USCIS receives your complete Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. According to 8 CFR 208.7, asylum applicants cannot apply for employment authorization until 180 days have passed on this clock.\n\nFor El Monte residents, understanding exactly how this clock works is critical because even small mistakes can stop the clock and delay your ability to work legally. The clock operates differently depending on whether you filed affirmatively with USCIS or defensively in immigration court.\n\nKey facts about the asylum clock:\n\n• The clock begins when USCIS receives a complete I-589 application\n• You need 180 days on the clock to file for EAD\n• The clock can stop for applicant-caused delays\n• Different rules apply for affirmative vs. defensive asylum cases\n• USCIS maintains this clock in their internal systems"

This means you can continue working while your renewal is pending. Keep your I-797C receipt notice with your expired EAD as proof of the extension.\n\nFor El Monte residents, we recommend setting calendar reminders well in advance of your EAD expiration date.

          content: "Many asylum seekers in El Monte encounter problems with their asylum clock that delay work authorization eligibility. Here are the most common issues and how to address them:\n\nProblem 1: Clock Stopped Without Your Knowledge\nUSCIS may have stopped your clock for a delay they attributed to you. Request your asylum clock status in writing from USCIS. If you believe the clock was stopped incorrectly, gather evidence showing the delay was government-caused.\n\nProblem 2: Incorrect Clock Calculation\nSometimes USCIS calculates the clock incorrectly, especially for cases transferred between offices. Keep meticulous records of all filings, receipts, and correspondence to prove your timeline.\n\nProblem 3: Case Referred to Immigration Court\nWhen an affirmative asylum case is referred to immigration court, the clock should continue running. Some applicants experience issues during this transition. Document your court hearing dates and any continuances.\n\nProblem 4: Attorney Changed or Withdrew\nIf your attorney withdraws or you change attorneys, the clock typically stops until you have new representation. Minimize this gap by securing new representation quickly.\n\nProblem 5: Motion to Reopen or Reconsider\nFiling certain motions can affect your clock. Consult with an immigration professional before filing any motion that might stop your clock.\n\nProblem 6: Amended Application Filing\nIf you need to amend your I-589, the clock generally continues. However, significant changes to your application should be carefully timed to avoid complications.\n\nWhen issues arise, document everything and consider seeking legal assistance. Our team at SoCal Immigration Services helps El Monte asylum seekers resolve clock disputes and delays."

Contact your congressional representative's office\n5. File a complaint with the USCIS Ombudsman\n6.

USCIS maintains internal records of your clock status. If you believe there is an error, request documentation showing when and why the clock was stopped.

However, if you already have a valid EAD and the clock stops, your existing work permit remains valid until its expiration date. The clock primarily affects initial EAD eligibility.

          q: "What happens if my asylum EAD application is denied?",
          a: "If your EAD application is denied, you will receive a denial notice explaining the reason. Common reasons include: clock has not reached 180 days, missing documentation, or clock stopped for applicant-caused delays. You can file a new application once the issue is resolved. There is no appeal process for EAD denials, but you can file a motion to reopen or reconsider in some cases. Our El Monte team reviews denial notices and advises on next steps."

USCIS has a 30-day processing goal after the 180-day mark, but actual times vary. Online filing generally results in faster processing.
