      locationIntro: "Long Beach, one of the most diverse cities in Southern California, is home to asylum seekers from around the world including many from the Middle East. Building a strong asylum case requires thorough documentation of both your personal persecution and the conditions in your home country. The evidence you gather can make the difference between approval and denial. This guide explains what evidence you need and how to obtain it.",
      summary: "A successful asylum case requires three types of evidence: personal testimony (your declaration), corroborating evidence (documents supporting your story), and country conditions evidence (showing persecution is real in your country). Strong cases combine all three. Evidence should be organized, translated, and presented clearly to asylum officers or immigration judges.",

          a: "There's no required length, but most effective declarations are 10-30 pages. Focus on quality over quantity. Include enough detail to show persecution was real and that you fear return, but avoid unnecessary repetition. Every paragraph should serve a purpose in establishing your claim. Complex cases with multiple incidents naturally require longer declarations."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I use evidence from social media about conditions in my country?",
          a: "Yes, but with caution. Social media posts, videos, and news articles shared online can demonstrate country conditions. However, you should verify the source is credible and the information is accurate. Supplement social media evidence with official sources like State Department reports. For personal evidence (threats you received on social media), take screenshots with dates visible."
        },
        {
          q: "What if my family is scared to write affidavits because they're still in danger?",
          a: "This is understandable and common. Explain in your declaration why family members cannot provide affidavits. The fact that your family fears retaliation for helping your case actually supports your claim of persecution. If they can provide anonymous or general statements without identifying information, this may be an option. Country conditions evidence can substitute for family affidavits."
        },
        {
          q: "I was persecuted by extremist groups, not the government. Does that count?",
          a: "Yes. Persecution by non-governmental actors qualifies if the government is unable or unwilling to control them. This includes extremist religious groups, militias, gangs, cartels, and political organizations. Document both the persecution by these groups AND the government's failure to protect you (reporting to police with no action, for example)."
        },
        {
          q: "Should I include evidence of PTSD or psychological harm?",
          a: "Psychological evaluation reports can be valuable evidence, especially for claims of past persecution. Mental health professionals can document symptoms consistent with trauma from persecution, which corroborates your account. Many asylum seekers have PTSD, anxiety, or depression from their experiences. A professional evaluation adds credibility to claims of harm."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I get official country conditions reports?",
          a: "State Department Human Rights Reports are available free at state.gov. USCIRF reports are at uscirf.gov. Human Rights Watch reports are at hrw.org. These are the most commonly cited sources. University libraries often have subscriptions to additional databases. Immigration legal aid organizations may have country conditions packets already compiled."
