          content: "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a federal immigration policy established in 2012 that provides temporary relief from deportation and work authorization to certain individuals who entered the United States as children without lawful immigration status. DACA does not provide a path to citizenship or permanent residency, but it offers crucial protections that allow recipients to live, work, and study in the United States without fear of immediate removal.\n\nFor Dreamers in Hemet and the Inland Empire, DACA provides several critical benefits:\n\n• Protection from deportation through deferred action status\n• Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to work legally in the United States\n• Social Security Number for employment, taxes, and identification purposes\n• Driver's license eligibility in California\n• Access to certain state benefits and in-state tuition at California public universities\n• Ability to obtain professional licenses in many fields\n\nHowever, DACA is granted in two-year increments, meaning recipients must renew their status regularly to maintain these protections. Failing to renew on time can result in loss of work authorization, driver's license suspension, and potential exposure to immigration enforcement. For Arab-American Dreamers supporting their families or pursuing educational goals, keeping DACA active is absolutely essential."

          content: "الإجراء المؤجل للقادمين في الطفولة (DACA) هو سياسة هجرة فيدرالية تأسست في عام 2012 توفر إعفاءً مؤقتاً من الترحيل وتصريح عمل لبعض الأفراد الذين دخلوا الولايات المتحدة كأطفال دون وضع هجرة قانوني. لا يوفر DACA مساراً للمواطنة أو الإقامة الدائمة، لكنه يقدم حماية حاسمة تسمح للمستفيدين بالعيش والعمل والدراسة في الولايات المتحدة دون خوف من الإبعاد الفوري.\n\nبالنسبة للحالمين في هيميت وإنلاند إمباير، يوفر DACA عدة فوائد حاسمة:\n\n• الحماية من الترحيل من خلال وضع الإجراء المؤجل\n• وثيقة تصريح العمل (EAD) للعمل بشكل قانوني في الولايات المتحدة\n• رقم الضمان الاجتماعي لأغراض التوظيف والضرائب والهوية\n• أهلية رخصة القيادة في كاليفورنيا\n• الوصول إلى مزايا حكومية معينة والرسوم الدراسية للمقيمين في جامعات كاليفورنيا العامة\n• القدرة على الحصول على تراخيص مهنية في العديد من المجالات\n\nومع ذلك، يُمنح DACA على فترات سنتين، مما يعني أن المستفيدين يجب أن يجددوا وضعهم بانتظام للحفاظ على هذه الحماية. الفشل في التجديد في الوقت المناسب يمكن أن يؤدي إلى فقدان تصريح العمل، وتعليق رخصة القيادة، والتعرض المحتمل لإنفاذ الهجرة. بالنسبة للحالمين العرب الأمريكيين الذين يدعمون عائلاتهم أو يسعون لتحقيق أهداف تعليمية، فإن الحفاظ على DACA نشطاً أمر ضروري للغاية."

          a: "إجمالي رسوم تقديم تجديد DACA هو $495، والتي تشمل $410 لطلب وثيقة تصريح العمل I-765 و $85 لخدمات البصمات. إعفاءات الرسوم غير متاحة لتجديدات DACA. تحقق من USCIS.gov لأي تحديثات على الرسوم."

          q: "ماذا لو اعتُقلت أو لدي سجل جنائي؟",
          a: "أي اعتقالات أو تهم أو إدانات منذ آخر موافقة DACA يجب الإفصاح عنها في طلب التجديد. ستحتاج لتقديم أحكام المحكمة ووثائق أخرى. بعض التاريخ الجنائي قد يستبعدك من DACA. استشر محامي هجرة قبل التقديم إذا كان لديك أي تاريخ جنائي."

        {
          q: "هل يمكنني التقدم لـ DACA للمرة الأولى في 2026؟",
          a: "حالياً، USCIS لا تقبل طلبات DACA الجديدة (للمرة الأولى) بسبب أوامر المحكمة الجارية. فقط الأفراد الذين حصلوا على DACA سابقاً يمكنهم تجديد وضعهم. هذا الوضع قد يتغير بناءً على قرارات المحكمة المستقبلية أو التشريعات."

          q: "أين أذهب لموعد البصمات بالقرب من هيميت؟",
          a: "متقدمو DACA في هيميت عادةً يتلقون مواعيد بصمات في مركز دعم تطبيقات USCIS في ريفرسايد (3630 13th Street) أو سان برناردينو (655 West Rialto Avenue). موقع موعدك المحدد سيُشار إليه في إشعار البصمات."

        {
          q: "هل يمكن لـ DACA أن يؤدي إلى بطاقة خضراء أو جنسية؟",
          a: "DACA بحد ذاته لا يوفر مساراً مباشراً للإقامة الدائمة أو الجنسية. ومع ذلك، بعض مستفيدي DACA قد يتأهلون للبطاقات الخضراء من خلال مسارات أخرى مثل الزواج من مواطن أمريكي، كفالة صاحب العمل، أو طلبات عائلية. إعادة الدخول مع advance parole قد تخلق دخولاً قانونياً يسهل تعديل الوضع المستقبلي. استشر فريقنا لاستكشاف خياراتك."
