      locationIntro: "For individuals in Perris who have previously been deported or have a prior removal order but face serious harm if returned to their home country, the Reasonable Fear Interview (RFI) provides a critical opportunity for protection. This specialized process allows those with prior orders to access Withholding of Removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. SoCal Immigration Services helps Inland Empire residents navigate this complex process.",

      answerCapsule: "A Reasonable Fear Interview is conducted by an asylum officer for individuals with prior removal orders who express fear of returning to their home country. If you pass the interview, your case is referred to Immigration Court where you can apply for Withholding of Removal or CAT protection. You cannot apply for asylum through this process, but you can avoid deportation to a dangerous country. Call (714) 421-8872 for help preparing for your RFI.",

If you pass, your case goes to Immigration Court for a full hearing.\n\n**Important Limitations:**\nThrough the RFI process, you can only pursue:\n- Withholding of Removal\n- Protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT)\n\nYou cannot pursue asylum through this process because a prior removal order bars you from asylum eligibility.",

This means:\n- No new hearing is required to deport you\n- The old order is simply put back into effect\n- However, if you express fear, you get an RFI\n\n**Expedited Removal:**\nIf you arrived at the border or were found near the border within 14 days of entry without proper documents, you may have been placed in expedited removal. If you expressed fear during that process, you should have received a credible fear interview. But if you had a prior order, you receive an RFI instead.\n\n**Expressing Fear:**\nAt any point during the reinstatement process, if you tell an immigration officer that you fear returning to your country, you must be given a Reasonable Fear Interview. It is critical to express this fear clearly and promptly.\n\n**The Timeline:**\n1. You are encountered by immigration enforcement\n2. Prior removal order is identified and reinstated\n3. You express fear of returning\n4. You are scheduled for a Reasonable Fear Interview\n5. Interview conducted (usually within days to weeks)\n6. Decision issued",

          q: "What is the difference between a Credible Fear Interview and a Reasonable Fear Interview?",
          a: "A Credible Fear Interview is for individuals without prior removal orders who are in expedited removal and can pursue asylum. A Reasonable Fear Interview is for individuals with prior removal orders whose orders are being reinstated. Those in RFI can only pursue Withholding of Removal and CAT protection, not asylum. The legal standard is also different - credible fear is a significant possibility of persecution, while reasonable fear is a reasonable possibility."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I apply for asylum if I pass my Reasonable Fear Interview?",
          a: "No. Even if you pass your RFI, you cannot apply for asylum because your prior removal order bars you from asylum eligibility. You can only apply for Withholding of Removal and/or protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). These provide important protection from deportation but do not lead to a green card."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if I fail my Reasonable Fear Interview?",
          a: "If the asylum officer finds that you do not have a reasonable fear, you can request review by an Immigration Judge. You should almost always make this request. The judge will review your claim and determine whether you have a reasonable fear. If the judge agrees with the asylum officer, you may be deported. If the judge disagrees, your case goes to Immigration Court for a full hearing."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I prepare for a Reasonable Fear Interview while in detention?",
          a: "Preparation while detained is challenging but possible. Practice explaining your fear clearly and in detail. Think about who would harm you, why they would harm you, and what has happened in the past. If family can help, ask them to gather any evidence - country condition reports, news articles, documents, photos. Try to stay calm and be ready to tell your story honestly and completely."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I have a lawyer at my Reasonable Fear Interview?",
          a: "Yes, you have the right to have an attorney present at your RFI. However, because most people are detained during this process and there is no right to a free attorney, many people do not have representation. If family members can contact an immigration attorney or service provider, they may be able to arrange representation or at least help you prepare."
        },
        {
          q: "How long does the Reasonable Fear Interview process take?",
          a: "The timeline varies but is generally faster than other immigration processes. Once you express fear, you should receive your interview within days to a few weeks. The decision often comes the same day or shortly after. If referred to Immigration Court, the court process takes longer - usually several months, though it can be longer depending on the court's schedule."
        },
        {
          q: "What if I have criminal charges for illegal re-entry?",
          a: "Many individuals with reinstated removal orders also face federal criminal charges for illegal re-entry under 8 U.S.C. 1326. The RFI process is separate from any criminal case. Even if you are convicted of illegal re-entry, you may still be able to pursue Withholding or CAT protection if you pass your RFI. However, certain convictions can bar these forms of relief, so legal analysis is important."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my family members be protected through my Reasonable Fear case?",
          a: "Unlike asylum, Withholding of Removal and CAT protection do not provide derivative status for family members. Each person who fears persecution or torture must file their own claim and prove their own case. If family members are also at risk, they should pursue their own applications for protection."

          q: "هل يمكنني التقدم للجوء إذا نجحت في مقابلة الخوف المعقول؟",

          q: "كيف أحضر لمقابلة الخوف المعقول أثناء الاحتجاز؟",
