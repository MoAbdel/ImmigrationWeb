Since the Supreme Court's landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, same-sex married couples have equal access to family-based immigration benefits.

If you are a U.S. citizen or green card holder legally married to a same-sex spouse, you can sponsor them for a green card just like any other married couple, with processing times of 12-24 months for citizen petitioners.",

          q: "Does USCIS recognize my same-sex marriage if my home country doesn't?",
          a: "Yes. USCIS recognizes your marriage based on where it was celebrated, not where you are from. If you were legally married in the United States, Canada, or any country where same-sex marriage is legal, USCIS will recognize that marriage regardless of your home country's laws. Many couples from countries where homosexuality is illegal have successfully obtained green cards through same-sex marriage."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I sponsor my same-sex spouse if I'm a green card holder, not a citizen?",
          a: "Yes, green card holders can sponsor same-sex spouses just like opposite-sex spouses. The difference is that your spouse falls under the F2A preference category rather than immediate relative, which means there may be a visa availability wait. Currently, the wait for F2A is approximately 2-3 years depending on the spouse's country of origin. Consider naturalization if eligible to eliminate this wait."
        },
        {
          q: "We kept our relationship secret in our home country. How do we prove our marriage is real?",
          a: "USCIS understands that LGBTQ+ couples from certain countries may have limited early documentation. Focus on evidence from when you could be open: joint accounts, lease, photos, social media from the U.S. or safe locations. Get affidavits from American friends, coworkers, or chosen family who have witnessed your relationship. A brief explanation in your cover letter about why early documentation is limited is appropriate."
        },
        {
          q: "What if my family won't support my marriage or provide affidavits?",
          a: "Family support is not required. Many LGBTQ+ couples have limited or no family support, and USCIS is aware of this reality. Affidavits can come from friends, neighbors, coworkers, religious community members, or anyone who has witnessed your relationship. Your chosen family's testimony is just as valid as biological family."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I apply for asylum based on LGBTQ+ persecution AND file a marriage petition?",
          a: "Yes, these are separate processes and can proceed simultaneously. If you are in the U.S. and face persecution in your home country due to your LGBTQ+ identity, you may have an asylum claim. Separately, if you are married to a U.S. citizen or green card holder, you can pursue a marriage-based green card. Discuss strategy with an immigration professional as each case is unique."
        },
        {
          q: "Is there any risk that my home country will find out about my U.S. same-sex marriage?",
          a: "USCIS does not notify foreign governments about immigration applications. However, marriage certificates are generally public records in the U.S. If safety is a concern, discuss with a legal professional about privacy protections. Once you have a green card, you are not required to return to your home country."
        },
        {
          q: "My spouse and I are both the same gender but one of us is transgender. Does this affect our petition?",
          a: "No. USCIS recognizes marriages based on the genders of the spouses as listed on their marriage certificate or as they identify. Transgender individuals can sponsor or be sponsored by spouses of any gender. USCIS does not require gender confirmation surgery or any particular documentation of gender identity for marriage-based petitions."
        },
        {
          q: "How long will the entire green card process take for my same-sex spouse?",
          a: "For U.S. citizen petitioners, expect 12-24 months total from I-130 filing to green card if your spouse is in the U.S. (adjustment of status) or 14-20 months if processing through a consulate abroad. For green card holder petitioners, add 2-3 years for visa availability wait. These timelines are identical to opposite-sex married couples."
