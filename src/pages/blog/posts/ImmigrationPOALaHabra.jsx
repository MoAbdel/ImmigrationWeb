          q: "Is Form G-28 the same as a power of attorney for immigration?",
          a: "Form G-28 serves a similar purpose to a power of attorney but is specific to immigration representation. Unlike traditional POA documents, the G-28 is a federal form that authorizes only licensed attorneys or DOJ-accredited representatives to appear before USCIS on your behalf. It must be filed separately for each immigration matter and does not grant the broad powers associated with a general power of attorney."

        {
          q: "Can a family member represent me in my immigration case?",
          a: "Family members have very limited ability to assist with immigration cases. They cannot complete Form G-28 or represent you before USCIS unless they are licensed attorneys. A family member may accompany you to an interview for support, but they cannot answer questions on your behalf or submit documents as your representative. For any substantive representation, you need an attorney or accredited representative."
        },
        {
          q: "How much does it cost to file Form G-28?",
          a: "Form G-28 itself has no filing fee. It is submitted without charge along with your immigration application or petition. However, your attorney or representative will charge for their services according to your fee agreement. If you use a DOJ-accredited representative through a recognized organization, their services may be free or low-cost depending on your financial situation."
        },
        {
          q: "What is the difference between an attorney and an accredited representative?",
          a: "An attorney is licensed by a state bar association and can represent clients in all legal matters, including federal courts. An accredited representative is authorized by the Department of Justice through a recognized nonprofit organization to provide immigration legal services specifically. Both can complete Form G-28 and represent you before USCIS, but only fully accredited representatives can also appear in immigration court."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my representative attend my USCIS interview without me?",
          a: "No, you must personally attend your USCIS interview. Your representative can accompany you to the interview, advocate on your behalf, clarify questions, and provide legal advice during the interview, but they cannot substitute for your presence. Certain applications, like naturalization, specifically require the applicant to appear in person for the examination."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I verify if someone is authorized to provide immigration legal services?",
          a: "For attorneys, verify their license through the state bar association where they claim membership. For accredited representatives, check the DOJ's Recognition and Accreditation roster available online. Be wary of anyone who cannot provide verification of their credentials. Immigration consultants and notarios are not authorized to represent you before USCIS regardless of what they may claim."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if my attorney stops practicing while my case is pending?",
          a: "If your attorney stops practicing, you will need to either find new representation or proceed on your own (pro se). Your former attorney must provide you with your complete case file. File a new G-28 with your new attorney or notify USCIS that you will be representing yourself. Make sure to update your address with USCIS if correspondence was being sent to your attorney's office."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need a separate G-28 for each family member's application?",
          a: "Yes, each person in your family needs their own Form G-28 even if the applications are being filed together. For minor children, a parent or legal guardian signs the G-28 on the child's behalf. If you are filing a family-based petition and adjustment applications together, you will need separate G-28 forms for the petitioner and each applicant."
