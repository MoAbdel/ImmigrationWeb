          q: "What is TPS re-registration?",
          a: "TPS re-registration is the process of renewing your Temporary Protected Status when DHS extends the TPS designation for your country. You must file during the announced registration period (usually 60 days) to maintain your protected status and work authorization. Each extension requires re-registration - previous registrations do not automatically carry over."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if I miss the TPS re-registration deadline?",
          a: "Missing the re-registration deadline can result in loss of your TPS status and work authorization. You may file late with an explanation showing good cause (such as serious illness), but late filing acceptance is discretionary and not guaranteed. It is critical to file within the registration period whenever possible."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need to re-register every time TPS is extended?",
          a: "Yes. Each time DHS extends TPS for your country, you must re-register during the announced registration period. Your previous registration does not automatically carry over to the new extension period. Monitor USCIS announcements and file promptly when registration opens."
        },
        {
          q: "Will my EAD automatically extend during re-registration?",
          a: "Often yes. When DHS extends TPS, they frequently announce automatic EAD extensions for current TPS holders. This allows you to continue working while your re-registration is processed. You must carry your expired EAD along with the Federal Register notice announcing the automatic extension as proof of work authorization."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I travel outside the U.S. while on TPS?",
          a: "You can travel, but you MUST obtain Advance Parole (Form I-131) BEFORE leaving the United States. Traveling without Advance Parole can be considered abandonment of your TPS. Upon return, present your Advance Parole document to be readmitted in TPS status."
        },
        {
          q: "What forms do I need for TPS re-registration?",
          a: "For re-registration, you need Form I-821 (Application for Temporary Protected Status). If you also want to renew your work permit, include Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization). You may also need Form I-912 if you are requesting a fee waiver. Always use current form versions from USCIS.gov."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I get a fee waiver for TPS re-registration?",
          a: "Yes, if you qualify. You may request a fee waiver using Form I-912 if you receive means-tested benefits (like SNAP or Medicaid), have income below 150% of poverty guidelines, or are experiencing financial hardship. Include evidence of your situation with the fee waiver request."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I know when my country's TPS registration period opens?",
          a: "DHS announces TPS extensions and registration periods in the Federal Register and on the USCIS website. Sign up for USCIS email updates, monitor uscis.gov/tps regularly, and consider working with an immigration service provider who tracks these deadlines. Registration periods are typically announced weeks before they open."

          a: "إعادة تسجيل TPS هي عملية تجديد وضع الحماية المؤقت الخاص بك عندما تمدد DHS تعيين TPS لبلدك. يجب عليك التقديم خلال فترة التسجيل المعلنة (عادةً 60 يوماً) للحفاظ على وضعك المحمي وتصريح العمل. كل تمديد يتطلب إعادة التسجيل - التسجيلات السابقة لا تنتقل تلقائياً."

          q: "ماذا يحدث إذا فوت موعد إعادة تسجيل TPS؟",
          a: "تفويت موعد إعادة التسجيل يمكن أن يؤدي إلى فقدان وضع TPS الخاص بك وتصريح العمل. قد تقدم متأخراً مع تفسير يُظهر سبباً وجيهاً (مثل مرض خطير)، لكن قبول التقديم المتأخر تقديري وغير مضمون. من الحاسم التقديم خلال فترة التسجيل كلما أمكن."

          q: "هل أحتاج إعادة التسجيل في كل مرة يُمدد فيها TPS؟",
          a: "نعم. في كل مرة تمدد فيها DHS TPS لبلدك، يجب عليك إعادة التسجيل خلال فترة التسجيل المعلنة. تسجيلك السابق لا ينتقل تلقائياً لفترة التمديد الجديدة. راقب إعلانات USCIS وقدم فوراً عند فتح التسجيل."

          q: "هل سيمتد EAD الخاص بي تلقائياً أثناء إعادة التسجيل؟",
          a: "غالباً نعم. عندما تمدد DHS TPS، يعلنون كثيراً عن تمديدات EAD تلقائية لحاملي TPS الحاليين. هذا يسمح لك بمواصلة العمل بينما تُعالج إعادة تسجيلك. يجب أن تحمل EAD المنتهي مع إشعار السجل الفيدرالي الذي يعلن التمديد التلقائي كدليل على تصريح العمل."

        {
          q: "ما النماذج التي أحتاجها لإعادة تسجيل TPS؟",
          a: "لإعادة التسجيل، تحتاج نموذج I-821 (طلب وضع الحماية المؤقت). إذا أردت أيضاً تجديد تصريح العمل، أدرج نموذج I-765 (طلب تصريح العمل). قد تحتاج أيضاً نموذج I-912 إذا كنت تطلب إعفاء من الرسوم. استخدم دائماً إصدارات النماذج الحالية من USCIS.gov."
