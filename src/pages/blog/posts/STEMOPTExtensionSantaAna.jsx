You must work for an E-Verify registered employer, file Form I-983 training plan, and apply within 60 days before your current OPT expires. SoCal Immigration Services helps Santa Ana area STEM graduates navigate this complex application process.",
      locationIntro: "Santa Ana serves as the county seat of Orange County and is home to a growing community of Arab international students and professionals pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. The STEM OPT Extension program offers these graduates an invaluable opportunity to extend their practical training in the United States for an additional 24 months beyond the standard 12-month OPT period. SoCal Immigration Services provides comprehensive document preparation assistance to STEM graduates throughout Santa Ana and the surrounding Orange County communities, helping them maximize their work authorization period while maintaining proper immigration status.",

          content: "The STEM OPT Extension is a 24-month extension of post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) available to F-1 students who have earned degrees in designated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. This extension allows qualified graduates to work in the United States for a total of up to 36 months (the initial 12-month OPT plus the 24-month STEM extension).\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security established the STEM OPT Extension program to address the growing demand for skilled STEM workers in the American economy. For international students who have invested years in obtaining their STEM education at American universities, this program provides a crucial bridge between graduation and potential sponsorship for longer-term work visas such as the H-1B.\n\nKey features of the STEM OPT Extension include:\n\n• 24 additional months of work authorization beyond standard OPT\n• Ability to apply for a second STEM OPT Extension if you earn another qualifying STEM degree\n• Automatic 180-day extension while your application is pending (cap-gap protection)\n• Opportunity to participate in multiple H-1B lotteries while on STEM OPT\n• Structured training component with employer mentorship requirements"

However, if you transferred from a community college to a four-year university and earned a bachelor's degree in a STEM field, you qualify for STEM OPT.

          q: "What happens if my E-Verify employer loses their E-Verify status during my STEM OPT?",
          a: "If your employer loses E-Verify status, you cannot continue employment with that employer under STEM OPT. You must find a new E-Verify enrolled employer within your unemployment day limits (150 days maximum combined with initial OPT). Report the change to your DSO immediately and begin searching for new qualifying employment. This situation counts as a material change requiring Form I-983 update."

If you file before your current OPT expires, you receive automatic 180-day work authorization while your application is pending. Premium processing is available for an additional $2,805 fee and guarantees a response within 15 business days. We recommend filing at least 60-90 days before your OPT expiration."

You must complete a separate Form I-983 for each employer, and each position must be at least 20 hours per week. Report all employers to your DSO and ensure combined hours meet program requirements."

          q: "What is the difference between STEM OPT unemployment limits and regular OPT?",

STEM OPT Extension allows an additional 60 days, for a combined total of 150 days of unemployment across your entire OPT period (initial OPT plus STEM extension). These days accumulate cumulatively. If you used 60 unemployment days during initial OPT, you have only 90 days remaining for your 24-month STEM OPT period."

However, if your promotion involves significant changes to your job duties, training plan, or supervisor, you must update the Form I-983 within 10 days.
