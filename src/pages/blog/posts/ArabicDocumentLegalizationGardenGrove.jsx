      locationIntro: "Garden Grove's large Arab and Middle Eastern community often needs to submit foreign documents for immigration purposes. Documents from Arab countries typically require authentication through embassy legalization since most Arab nations are not part of the Hague Apostille Convention. Understanding this process helps you prepare proper documentation for USCIS applications.",
      summary: "Documents from most Arab countries require embassy legalization (not apostille) before USCIS will accept them. The process involves authentication in the country of origin, legalization at the embassy of that country in the U.S., and certified translation into English. Different document types (birth certificates, marriage certificates, educational records) may have different requirements.",

          q: "My country is not part of the Hague Convention. What do I do?",
          a: "You need embassy legalization instead of an apostille. This means getting your document authenticated by your home country's Foreign Ministry (or equivalent), then having it legalized by your country's embassy or consulate in the United States. After legalization, get a certified English translation. Submit both the legalized document and translation to USCIS."

          q: "How do I get a document authenticated from a country I can't return to?",
          a: "Contact family or friends who can go to the relevant government office on your behalf. Many countries allow agents to obtain documents with proper authorization. Some documents can be requested by mail or through embassy services. If circumstances truly prevent obtaining documents (war, persecution), explain this to USCIS and provide whatever alternative evidence you can."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need to translate documents that are partially in English?",
          a: "If any part of the document is in a language other than English, the entire document should be translated. Even stamps, seals, and handwritten notes need translation. USCIS wants to understand everything on the document. The translator should translate all visible text, noting things like stamps and signatures."
        },
        {
          q: "My name is spelled differently on different documents. Is that a problem?",
          a: "Name variations are very common with Arabic names transliterated into English. USCIS is familiar with this. Provide an affidavit explaining that the different spellings refer to the same person. Consistent variations (like Mohamed vs. Mohammed) are generally easy to explain. Include any legal name change documents if applicable."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I use documents from embassies in other countries?",
          a: "Documents should ideally be legalized by your country's embassy in the United States for U.S. immigration purposes. However, documents legalized by your country's embassy in another country may be accepted. USCIS cares that the document is properly authenticated - explain in a cover letter if you used an embassy in another country."
        },
        {
          q: "How long are legalized documents valid for USCIS purposes?",
          a: "Most civil documents (birth certificates, marriage certificates) don't expire for USCIS purposes. Police clearances are generally valid for 12-24 months. Medical examinations have specific validity periods (usually 6 months to 2 years depending on circumstances). The legalization itself doesn't expire, but USCIS may request updated documents if significant time has passed."
