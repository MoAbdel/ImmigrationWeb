Whether you work in the corporate offices near Fashion Island, manage operations for an international company headquartered along Pacific Coast Highway, or oversee business interests in the Newport Beach area, the EB-1C multinational manager category offers a direct path to permanent residency.

          a: "L-1A is a nonimmigrant (temporary) visa that allows multinational managers and executives to work in the U.S. for up to 7 years. EB-1C is an immigrant visa category that leads directly to a green card (permanent residency). Both have similar requirements regarding managerial/executive capacity and multinational employment. Many use L-1A as a stepping stone to EB-1C, but you can file EB-1C directly through consular processing without first obtaining L-1A status."
        },
        {
          q: "How long does the EB-1C process take?",
          a: "With premium processing, the I-140 petition is adjudicated within 15-45 days. Without premium processing, I-140 typically takes 4-8 months. If priority dates are current (as they usually are for EB-1C), you can file I-485 adjustment of status concurrently or immediately after I-140 approval. The I-485 stage typically adds 8-18 months. Overall, the entire process from filing to green card typically takes 12-24 months."
        },
        {
          q: "Can a small company sponsor an EB-1C petition?",
          a: "Yes, but with challenges. The company must demonstrate sufficient organizational complexity to support a managerial or executive position. USCIS looks at the number of employees, their roles, and the organizational structure. A very small company where the beneficiary would perform operational duties alongside managerial functions may not qualify. Generally, having professional or supervisory subordinates strengthens the case."
        },
        {
          q: "What if my company abroad is small?",
          a: "The foreign company size matters for establishing you worked in a managerial or executive capacity abroad. A small foreign operation where you performed primarily non-managerial duties may not satisfy the one-year requirement. However, function managers who manage essential functions without many subordinates can potentially qualify. Documentation of your actual duties abroad is crucial."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my spouse and children get green cards through EB-1C?",
          a: "Yes. Your spouse and unmarried children under 21 can be included as derivative beneficiaries on your EB-1C petition. They will receive green cards at the same time as you. Your spouse will also receive employment authorization upon filing the I-485 adjustment application or upon immigrant visa issuance. Children can maintain status until age 21 under the Child Status Protection Act."
        },
        {
          q: "What is the minimum salary for EB-1C?",
          a: "Unlike PERM-based categories, EB-1C has no prevailing wage requirement. However, the salary must be reasonable for the position and the company must demonstrate ability to pay. USCIS will question unusually low salaries for executive positions. The salary should be consistent with the claimed level of responsibility and industry standards."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I start a new company in the U.S. and file EB-1C?",
          a: "Yes, but new office petitions face higher scrutiny. You must demonstrate the U.S. entity has secured sufficient physical premises, has the financial ability to pay your salary, and will realistically support a managerial or executive position within one year. A detailed business plan showing growth projections is required. Initial approval is typically for only one year, requiring extension with evidence of development."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if my EB-1C petition is denied?",
          a: "If denied, you can file a motion to reopen (if new evidence available) or motion to reconsider (if USCIS made an error). You can also appeal to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO). Alternatively, you may file a new petition addressing the deficiencies. If you're in L-1A status, denial of EB-1C doesn't affect your L-1A status, but you should consult an attorney about next steps."
