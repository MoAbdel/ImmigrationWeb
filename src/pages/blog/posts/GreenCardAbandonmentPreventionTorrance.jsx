      locationIntro: "Torrance and the South Bay are home to many permanent residents who maintain business, family, or professional ties abroad. Whether you work for an international company, need to care for family overseas, or have other reasons to spend extended time outside the United States, understanding how to protect your green card from abandonment is essential.",
      summary: "A green card can be considered abandoned if you spend too much time outside the U.S. or take actions showing you've given up U.S. residence. Trips over 6 months create presumption of abandonment; trips over 1 year break continuous residence. To protect your status, apply for a re-entry permit before long trips, maintain strong U.S. ties, and file taxes as a resident. If problems occur at re-entry, knowing your rights is crucial.",

          q: "I've been abroad 8 months. Will I lose my green card?",
          a: "Probably not, but you may face questions at the port of entry. Trips between 6-12 months create a presumption of abandonment that you can overcome with evidence of continued ties to the U.S. Bring documentation showing you maintained a U.S. address, paid U.S. taxes, kept bank accounts active, and had a legitimate reason for the extended trip. Be prepared to explain your absence."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need a re-entry permit for a 7-month trip?",
          a: "It's advisable but not strictly required. A re-entry permit for trips under 1 year mainly provides peace of mind and documentation that you intended to return. It signals to CBP that you planned ahead and intend to maintain residence. For trips approaching or exceeding 1 year, a re-entry permit becomes essential. Apply before you leave."
        },
        {
          q: "My company is sending me abroad for 3 years. How do I keep my green card?",
          a: "This is challenging. Get a re-entry permit before leaving (valid 2 years). Apply for a second re-entry permit before the first expires (you may need to return to U.S. to apply). Maintain all U.S. ties possible. Even with permits, 3+ years abroad carries significant abandonment risk. Consider whether your employer can structure the assignment differently, or consult an attorney about your specific situation."
        },
        {
          q: "CBP stopped me and wants me to sign I-407. What do I do?",
          a: "Do NOT sign I-407 unless you truly want to give up your green card. You have the right to refuse and request to see an immigration judge instead. Tell CBP you do not wish to abandon your status and want a hearing. They cannot force you to sign. You may be paroled in or placed in proceedings, but you'll have a chance to present your case. Consult an attorney as soon as possible."
        },
        {
          q: "Does filing U.S. taxes help prove I'm still a resident?",
          a: "Yes, significantly. Filing taxes as a U.S. resident (reporting worldwide income) is one of the strongest pieces of evidence that you consider the U.S. your home. Conversely, failing to file or filing as a non-resident can be used against you. Keep copies of all tax returns and be prepared to show them at port of entry or in any abandonment proceedings."
        },
        {
          q: "I'm caring for a dying parent abroad. Will I lose my green card?",
          a: "Courts and USCIS recognize compelling circumstances. Document everything: your parent's medical condition, why you needed to be there, your efforts to return when possible, and all the U.S. ties you maintained. Get a re-entry permit before leaving if possible. If you must stay longer than 2 years, document why return wasn't possible. Compassionate circumstances can overcome abandonment claims, but strong documentation is essential."
