      locationIntro: "West Covina, located in the eastern San Gabriel Valley of Los Angeles County, is home to a thriving Arab-American community. Many residents hold Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) that require timely renewal to maintain work authorization. Filing your EAD renewal 180 days before expiration is the single most important step you can take to protect your employment status and avoid gaps in work authorization.",

          heading: "What is EAD Renewal?",
          content: "The Employment Authorization Document (EAD), commonly called a work permit, is a card issued by USCIS that proves you are authorized to work in the United States. Unlike employment-based visas tied to specific employers, an EAD allows you to work for any U.S. employer in any position.\n\nEAD renewal is the process of extending your work authorization before your current card expires. The renewal process involves filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with supporting documentation proving your continued eligibility for work authorization.\n\nKey facts about EAD renewal:\n\n• Your EAD category determines renewal eligibility and requirements\n• Most EADs are valid for 1-2 years and must be renewed\n• USCIS recommends filing renewal applications 180 days before expiration\n• Certain categories qualify for automatic 180-day extensions\n• You cannot work with an expired EAD unless you have an automatic extension\n• The renewal process is similar to the initial application process"

USCIS allows and encourages applicants to file renewal applications up to 180 days (approximately 6 months) before their current EAD expires.\n\nFiling 180 days early provides several important benefits:\n\n• Protects against processing delays that could leave you unable to work\n• Qualifies you for the 180-day automatic extension (for eligible categories)\n• Gives USCIS adequate time to process your application\n• Reduces stress and allows time to address any issues\n• Demonstrates compliance with immigration requirements to your employer\n\nThe 180-day advance filing window is not just a suggestion - it is a strategic requirement for protecting your employment. Processing times in 2026 range from 3-7 months depending on your category and service center, making early filing essential.",
