      locationIntro: "For F-1 students in Aliso Viejo with pending H-1B petitions, the cap gap provision is crucial for maintaining lawful status and work authorization during the transition period. When your OPT ends before your H-1B starts, the cap gap automatically extends your F-1 status and, in many cases, your employment authorization. SoCal Immigration Services helps South Orange County professionals navigate this critical transition.",

      answerCapsule: "The H-1B cap gap automatically extends F-1 status and OPT work authorization for students whose H-1B petition is filed while they are still in valid F-1 status. The extension covers the gap between when OPT expires and when H-1B status begins on October 1. This allows you to remain in the U.S. and continue working legally during the transition. Call (714) 421-8872 for help understanding your cap gap eligibility.",

USCIS created the cap gap extension to address this problem.\n\n**The Problem:**\n- OPT typically expires before October 1\n- Regular H-1B status cannot begin until October 1\n- Without cap gap, students would be out of status for months\n- They would have to stop working and potentially leave the U.S.\n\n**The Solution:**\nThe cap gap provision automatically extends:\n- F-1 student status until October 1\n- OPT employment authorization until October 1 (if certain conditions are met)\n\n**Who Benefits:**\n- F-1 students on OPT or STEM OPT\n- Those with a cap-subject H-1B petition filed on their behalf\n- Students who were in valid F-1 status when the petition was filed\n\n**Key Dates:**\n- H-1B cap petitions are typically filed in April (lottery)\n- H-1B status begins October 1\n- Cap gap covers the period between OPT expiration and October 1",

The cap gap extension automatically extends F-1 status to October 1 for students with pending cap-subject H-1B petitions, and extends work authorization if OPT was valid when the petition was filed."

          q: "Can I work during the cap gap?",
          a: "Yes, if you had valid OPT employment authorization when your employer filed the H-1B petition. Your work authorization is automatically extended until October 1 (or until the petition is denied/withdrawn). If your OPT had already expired before the H-1B was filed, your status is extended but not your work authorization."

          q: "Do I need to apply for cap gap extension?",
          a: "No, the cap gap extension is automatic. You do not file a separate application. When a cap-subject H-1B petition requesting change of status is filed on your behalf while you are in valid F-1 status, the cap gap extension automatically applies. Keep your receipt notice as proof."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I travel internationally during the cap gap?",
          a: "International travel during cap gap is very risky and not recommended. Leaving the U.S. can end your cap gap status. You would need a valid visa to return, and your H-1B visa cannot be issued until after October 1 when the status becomes active. Consult with an immigration professional before any travel."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if my H-1B petition is denied?",
          a: "If your H-1B petition is denied, your cap gap protection ends on the denial date. Work authorization stops immediately. You typically have a 60-day grace period to depart the U.S. or change to another status. Options include filing a motion to reopen, returning to STEM OPT if time remains, or exploring other visa categories."
        },
        {
          q: "What documents prove my cap gap status?",
          a: "Key documents include: (1) Form I-797 Receipt Notice showing the H-1B petition was filed, (2) your EAD card (even if the date has passed), (3) valid passport, (4) I-94 showing F-1 status, and (5) I-20 with OPT authorization. The receipt notice is most important for proving cap gap."
        },
        {
          q: "Does cap gap apply to cap-exempt H-1B positions?",
          a: "No. Cap gap only applies to cap-subject H-1B petitions. Cap-exempt positions (universities, nonprofit research organizations, government research organizations) do not go through the lottery and can have start dates throughout the year, so cap gap is not needed."
        },

          q: "What if I am on STEM OPT during cap gap?",
          a: "If you are on STEM OPT and it extends past October 1, you may not need cap gap protection. If your STEM OPT expires before October 1, cap gap extends your status and work authorization to October 1, just like regular OPT. STEM OPT also allows multiple lottery attempts."
