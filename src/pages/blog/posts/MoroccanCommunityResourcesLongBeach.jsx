          q: "Is Morocco eligible for the Diversity Visa lottery?",
          a: "Yes, Morocco has been consistently eligible for the DV lottery. However, eligibility is determined each year based on immigration numbers, so always check the current year's instructions. Morocco typically remains eligible because it has not sent 50,000 immigrants to the U.S. in the previous five years. The lottery is free - only register at dvprogram.state.gov."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I get my Moroccan documents apostilled?",
          a: "Since Morocco joined the Hague Apostille Convention in 2016, you can get documents apostilled in Morocco rather than going through the full embassy legalization process. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs or designated authorities in Morocco can issue apostilles. This makes document authentication faster and simpler than for countries not in the Hague Convention."
        },
        {
          q: "Will I lose my Moroccan citizenship if I become a U.S. citizen?",
          a: "No. Morocco allows dual citizenship. When you naturalize as a U.S. citizen, you retain your Moroccan nationality. You can hold both passports and use whichever is appropriate for your travel. Many Moroccan-Americans maintain dual citizenship, enjoying the benefits of both nationalities."
        },
        {
          q: "My documents are in French. Do I still need translation?",
          a: "Yes. USCIS requires all documents in a language other than English to be translated into English. Even though many officials may understand French, the translation requirement ensures consistency and a proper record. Get a certified English translation from a qualified translator."
        },
        {
          q: "I was married by an Adoul (religious authority) in Morocco. Is this valid for immigration?",
          a: "Adoul marriages are legally recognized in Morocco and therefore recognized for U.S. immigration purposes. You'll need the marriage certificate from the Adoul, properly apostilled, and translated into English. USCIS recognizes marriages that are valid in the country where they occurred."
        },
        {
          q: "Where is the Moroccan Consulate serving Long Beach?",

They provide passport services, civil status documents, notarization, and other consular services. Check their website for current hours and appointment requirements."
