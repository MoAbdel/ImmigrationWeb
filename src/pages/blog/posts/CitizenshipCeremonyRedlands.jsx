      introduction: `After months or years of preparation, interviews, and waiting, you have finally received the news you have been hoping for: your naturalization application has been approved. Now comes the final and most meaningful step in your journey to becoming an American citizen - the Oath of Allegiance ceremony. For residents of Redlands and the surrounding Inland Empire communities, understanding what to expect at your citizenship ceremony will help you prepare for this momentous occasion and ensure everything goes smoothly on the day you officially become a United States citizen.

The naturalization ceremony is more than just a legal formality. It is a celebration of your achievement, a recognition of your commitment to your new country, and the beginning of a new chapter in your life. Many applicants describe the ceremony as an emotional and transformative experience, surrounded by fellow immigrants from around the world who have all worked hard to reach this same moment. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every aspect of the citizenship ceremony, from practical preparations to understanding the significance of the oath you will take.

At Dalia Law Group, we have helped thousands of immigrants in Redlands, San Bernardino, and throughout Southern California complete their naturalization journey. We understand the questions and concerns that arise as the ceremony date approaches, and we are here to ensure you feel fully prepared and confident on this special day.`,

          title: "What Happens at the Citizenship Ceremony",
          content: `The naturalization ceremony is a carefully structured event designed to welcome new citizens into the American community. Understanding what will happen at each stage helps you feel prepared and allows you to fully appreciate the significance of the occasion.

**Before the Ceremony Begins**

You should arrive at least 30 minutes before your scheduled ceremony time. Upon arrival, you will go through security screening similar to airport security. USCIS officers will then check you in by verifying your identity and collecting your Permanent Resident Card (green card). Make sure your green card is easily accessible, as you must surrender it during check-in.

After check-in, you will receive materials including a small American flag to wave during the ceremony and informational packets about registering to vote, applying for a passport, and your rights and responsibilities as a citizen.

**The Ceremony Program**

Most naturalization ceremonies follow a similar format:

| Ceremony Element | Duration | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Check-in and seating | 30-45 minutes | Identity verification and green card collection |
| Opening remarks | 5-10 minutes | Welcome from USCIS official or presiding officer |
| Keynote address | 10-15 minutes | Often given by a local dignitary, judge, or notable citizen |
| Roll call of nations | 5-10 minutes | Countries of origin are announced, and you stand when yours is called |
| Oath of Allegiance | 5 minutes | The most important part where you officially become a citizen |
| Pledge of Allegiance | 2 minutes | Your first time reciting the pledge as an American citizen |
| National Anthem | 3 minutes | Often sung by a local performer or played as recording |
| Certificate distribution | 30-60 minutes | You receive your Certificate of Naturalization |
| Closing remarks | 5 minutes | Final congratulations and dismissal |

**The Emotional Impact**

Many new citizens describe the ceremony as surprisingly emotional. Hearing the names of dozens of countries called out reminds you that you are part of a long tradition of immigrants who have built America. When you stand with others from your country of origin - whether Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Yemen, or any other nation - you feel connected to those who have made similar journeys.

The moment when the presiding officer pronounces you a citizen of the United States often brings tears to the eyes of even those who expected to remain composed. This is a significant milestone worthy of emotional recognition.`

          title: "Same-Day Ceremonies vs. Scheduled Ceremonies",
          content: `USCIS offers two types of naturalization ceremonies, and understanding the difference helps you plan appropriately.

**Same-Day Administrative Ceremonies**

Some USCIS field offices offer same-day oath ceremonies immediately following your naturalization interview if you are approved. These administrative ceremonies are conducted by USCIS officers rather than judges.

Advantages of same-day ceremonies:
- Complete the entire process in one visit
- No additional waiting after approval
- Convenient for those who traveled far for their interview
- Become a citizen the same day you pass your interview

Disadvantages of same-day ceremonies:
- Less formal atmosphere
- Smaller groups of new citizens
- Family members may not be able to attend
- Less time to prepare emotionally

**Scheduled Judicial Ceremonies**

If a same-day ceremony is not available or you prefer a more formal event, you will be scheduled for a judicial ceremony at a later date. These ceremonies are typically held at federal courthouses, convention centers, or other large venues and are presided over by federal judges.

Advantages of scheduled ceremonies:
- More formal and memorable atmosphere
- Often hundreds of new citizens taking the oath together
- Family and friends can attend
- Time to prepare and invite loved ones
- Sometimes held at historic or significant locations

**Ceremony Locations Near Redlands**

| Location | Type | Typical Capacity | Distance from Redlands |
|----------|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| San Bernardino USCIS Office | Administrative | 25-50 | 8 miles |
| Riverside Federal Courthouse | Judicial | 100-200 | 15 miles |
| Los Angeles Convention Center | Judicial | 3,000-7,000 | 60 miles |
| Pomona Fairplex | Judicial | 500-1,000 | 35 miles |
| Ontario Convention Center | Judicial | 500-1,000 | 25 miles |

You generally cannot choose your ceremony type or location. USCIS assigns you based on their schedule and your application processing office. However, if you have a compelling reason to request a different ceremony date or location, you may contact USCIS, though such requests are rarely granted.`

        {
          title: "What to Bring to Your Citizenship Ceremony",
          content: `Being properly prepared ensures your ceremony goes smoothly and you leave with all necessary documents.

**Required Items - You Must Bring These**

Your ceremony notice letter (Form N-445) is absolutely essential. This document was mailed to you after your interview approval and contains your ceremony date, time, and location. You cannot participate in the ceremony without it.

Your Permanent Resident Card (green card) must be surrendered at check-in. USCIS collects green cards because you will no longer need permanent resident status once you become a citizen. If you have lost your green card, contact USCIS before your ceremony date.

A valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license, state ID, or passport from your home country) is needed for identity verification.

**Completing the N-445 Questionnaire**

The back of your Form N-445 contains questions you must answer truthfully before taking the oath. These questions ask whether anything has changed since your interview, including:

- Have you traveled outside the United States?
- Have you married or divorced?
- Have you been arrested or charged with any crime?
- Have you changed your address?
- Have you joined any organizations?

You must answer these questions at the ceremony and sign the form in front of a USCIS officer. If you answer "yes" to any question, you may be asked to step aside for additional questioning before being allowed to participate in the ceremony.

**Recommended Items to Bring**

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Water bottle (empty, to fill after security) | Ceremonies can be long, especially in summer |
| Light snack | Blood sugar maintenance during wait times |
| Reading material | Entertainment during waiting periods |
| Phone with camera | Photos with family after the ceremony |
| Tissues | Many people become emotional during the oath |
| Sweater or jacket | Venue air conditioning can be cold |
| Pen | Completing paperwork |

**Items to Leave at Home**

Do not bring weapons of any kind, including pocket knives. Large bags may slow your security screening. While phones are permitted, be prepared to silence them during the ceremony.`
        },
        {
          title: "Understanding the Oath of Allegiance",
          content: `The Oath of Allegiance is the legal mechanism by which you become a United States citizen. Understanding each phrase helps you appreciate the commitments you are making.

**The Full Text of the Oath**

"I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God."

**Understanding Each Element**

The oath contains several distinct promises:

**Renunciation of foreign allegiances**: You are pledging primary loyalty to the United States. However, this does not automatically revoke your previous citizenship. Many countries, including some Arab nations, have their own rules about dual citizenship that are not affected by the US oath.

**Support and defend the Constitution**: You promise to uphold American laws and the principles of the Constitution, including freedom of speech, religion, and other rights.

**Bear arms if required**: You agree to serve in the military if legally required. However, this does not mean you will be drafted, and the US has not had mandatory military service since 1973.

**Noncombatant service**: If you cannot bear arms due to religious or moral objections, you agree to serve in non-fighting roles.

**Work of national importance**: You agree to contribute to the nation's needs during emergencies.

**Modified Oath for Religious or Conscientious Objectors**

If your religious beliefs or moral convictions prevent you from taking certain parts of the oath, you may request a modified version that omits references to bearing arms, noncombatant service, or the phrase "so help me God." You should have already discussed this with USCIS during your interview if applicable.

**Taking the Oath**

At the ceremony, everyone stands and raises their right hand. The presiding officer reads the oath in segments, and you repeat each segment. Speak clearly and audibly. This is not a test - you will not fail for mispronouncing words. The important thing is your sincere commitment to the words you are speaking.

The moment the oath concludes, you are legally a United States citizen. Everything that follows - receiving your certificate, being welcomed as a citizen - is ceremonial. The oath itself is the legal transformation.`
        },
        {
          title: "Name Changes at Your Naturalization Ceremony",
          content: `The naturalization process offers a unique opportunity to legally change your name without going through separate court proceedings. Understanding your options helps you make the right decision for your situation.

**When Name Changes Are Handled**

If you requested a name change on your N-400 application, the presiding judge at a judicial ceremony can legally change your name as part of the naturalization proceedings. Administrative ceremonies conducted by USCIS officers typically cannot process name changes.

**Types of Name Changes Available**

| Change Type | Example | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Anglicizing your name | Muhammad to Michael | Common among immigrants seeking easier pronunciation |
| Adopting spouse's surname | Keeping maiden name to adding married name | For those who married during the green card period |
| Correcting spelling | Fixing transliteration errors | From Arabic to English, names are often spelled inconsistently |
| Removing or adding middle names | Adding family names or removing unwanted names | Reflects cultural preferences |
| Adopting American name entirely | Abdullah Al-Hassan to Anthony Harrison | Complete transformation |

**Considerations for Arab Immigrants**

Arabic names often face transliteration challenges when converted to English letters. Your name may be spelled differently on various documents (passport, birth certificate, green card). The naturalization ceremony is an opportunity to standardize your name spelling.

Some applicants choose to keep their Arabic name exactly as written on their green card, maintaining their cultural identity. Others prefer to adopt names that are easier for Americans to pronounce, potentially reducing discrimination in employment or social situations. Neither choice is right or wrong - it is a personal decision.

**If You Did Not Request a Name Change But Want One**

If you did not request a name change on your original N-400 but have since decided you want one, it may be too late for your scheduled ceremony. You would need to:

1. Contact USCIS to discuss options before your ceremony date
2. In some cases, go through a separate legal name change process after naturalization

**After the Name Change**

If your name is changed during the ceremony, your Certificate of Naturalization will show your new legal name. You must then update:

- Social Security Administration
- State DMV for driver's license
- Passport (apply with new name)
- Bank accounts
- Employment records
- Property deeds
- Credit cards
- Insurance policies

Keep your Certificate of Naturalization safe, as it is your proof of both citizenship and legal name change.`

        {
          title: "Receiving Your Certificate of Naturalization",
          content: `The Certificate of Naturalization (Form N-550) is one of the most important documents you will ever receive. Understanding its significance and proper care ensures you can prove your citizenship throughout your life.

**What the Certificate Contains**

Your Certificate of Naturalization includes:

- Your full legal name (including any name change)
- Your photograph
- Your date of birth
- Country of former nationality
- Date you became a citizen
- Certificate number (unique identifier)
- USCIS official signatures and seal

**Receiving Your Certificate at the Ceremony**

After the oath, certificates are distributed. This can take 30 minutes to over an hour depending on the ceremony size. Your name will be called, or you will proceed in an organized line. When you receive your certificate:

1. **Verify all information immediately** - Check your name spelling, date of birth, and photo
2. **Report any errors before leaving** - Corrections are much easier to make at the ceremony than later
3. **Sign the certificate** - You must sign in the designated area
4. **Keep it in the protective folder** - Do not fold, laminate, or damage the certificate

**If There Are Errors on Your Certificate**

| Error Type | Action Required |
|------------|-----------------|
| Misspelled name | Report immediately; request correction form |
| Wrong date of birth | Report immediately; may delay departure |
| Photo issues | Report immediately |
| Minor clerical errors | May be corrected at ceremony or through N-565 application |
| Significant errors | May require new ceremony date |

**Protecting Your Certificate**

Your Certificate of Naturalization is irreplaceable in its original form. While you can obtain a replacement through Form N-565 ($555 filing fee), the process takes months and creates unnecessary complications.

Storage recommendations:
- Keep the original in a fireproof safe or safety deposit box
- Make high-quality color copies for your records
- Scan a digital copy stored securely in cloud storage
- Never carry the original unless absolutely necessary

**When You Will Need Your Certificate**

- Applying for a US passport
- Registering to vote
- Proving citizenship for employment (I-9 form)
- Sponsoring family members for immigration
- Certain government jobs requiring citizenship verification
- Obtaining security clearances

Your certificate, along with your US passport, serves as proof of citizenship for the rest of your life.`

        {
          title: "Registering to Vote as a New Citizen",
          content: `One of the most significant rights you gain as a new American citizen is the right to vote. Many naturalization ceremonies include voter registration opportunities, and understanding the process helps you exercise this right.

**Voter Registration at the Ceremony**

Most naturalization ceremonies have voter registration tables staffed by local election officials or nonpartisan organizations. You can register immediately after receiving your certificate.

Information needed to register:
- Your new Certificate of Naturalization (for proof of citizenship)
- Current address in Redlands or your California city
- Date of birth
- California driver's license or state ID number (if you have one)
- Last four digits of your Social Security number

**Understanding Voter Registration in California**

| Registration Method | Timeline | Notes |
|--------------------|----------|-------|
| Same-day at ceremony | Immediate | Often available at ceremonies |
| Online at registertovote.ca.gov | 15 days before election | Requires CA driver's license or ID |
| By mail | 15 days before election | Form available at post offices, libraries |
| Conditional registration | Up to and including Election Day | Available at county elections office |

**Party Affiliation Options**

When registering in California, you choose a party affiliation or no party preference:
- Democratic Party
- Republican Party
- American Independent Party (not the same as "independent")
- Green Party
- Libertarian Party
- Peace and Freedom Party
- No Party Preference

Choosing "No Party Preference" means you are an independent voter. In California primary elections, you may still vote in some party primaries depending on party rules.

**Your First Elections**

As a new citizen, you can vote in:
- Federal elections (President, US Senate, US House of Representatives)
- State elections (Governor, state legislature, state ballot measures)
- Local elections (Mayor, City Council, school board, local measures)
- Special elections

**Civic Responsibility and Engagement**

Voting is one way to participate in American democracy. As a naturalized citizen, you can also:
- Serve on juries (you may be called for jury duty)
- Run for most elected offices
- Participate in community meetings and local government
- Contact your elected representatives about issues you care about

Many Arab immigrants find that participating in local politics is an effective way to advocate for their community and ensure their voices are heard on issues affecting immigrant families.`

        {
          title: "Applying for Your US Passport",
          content: `With your citizenship confirmed, you can now apply for a US passport. Many new citizens make this their first priority, especially those who want to travel or need additional proof of citizenship.

**When to Apply for Your Passport**

You can apply for a passport immediately after your naturalization ceremony. Many ceremonies have passport application facilities on-site, allowing you to submit your application the same day. Otherwise, you can apply at:

- Post offices that accept passport applications
- Passport acceptance facilities
- Regional passport agencies (for urgent travel)

**Passport Application Requirements**

| Document/Item | Purpose | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| Certificate of Naturalization (original) | Proof of citizenship | Returned by mail after processing |
| Passport photo (2x2 inches) | Identity verification | Specific requirements apply |
| Completed Form DS-11 | Application form | Must complete in person for first-time applicants |
| Payment ($165 total for adult passport book) | Processing fee | Includes $35 acceptance fee |
| Valid ID | Identity verification | Driver's license or state ID |

**Passport Processing Times**

| Service Type | Processing Time | Total Cost (Book) |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Routine | 6-8 weeks | $165 |
| Expedited | 2-3 weeks | $225 |
| Urgent (agency appointment) | Same day to 2 weeks | $225 + travel to agency |

**Passport Card vs. Passport Book**

The passport card ($65) is valid only for land and sea travel to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. For air travel anywhere or travel outside North America, you need the passport book. Most new citizens apply for the book, and many get both for convenience.

**Travel Considerations for New Citizens**

While your passport application is processing, your Certificate of Naturalization can serve as proof of citizenship for domestic purposes. However, you cannot use it for international travel. Plan your first international trip after receiving your passport.

**Dual Citizenship Considerations**

The US allows dual citizenship. Having a US passport does not require surrendering other citizenships or passports. However, when entering and leaving the US, you must use your US passport. Your other passport(s) may be used for travel to your country of origin if that country also recognizes dual citizenship.

Some Arab countries have specific rules about dual citizenship:
- Some countries automatically revoke citizenship when you naturalize elsewhere
- Some require you to renounce or may not recognize your US citizenship
- Some fully accept dual citizenship

Research your country of origin's rules, and consult with an immigration attorney if you have questions about maintaining dual status.`

          title: "Bringing Family Members to Your Ceremony",
          content: `Your naturalization ceremony is a milestone worth sharing with loved ones. Understanding the policies and opportunities for family participation helps you plan accordingly.

**Family Attendance Policies**

**Judicial Ceremonies**: Generally welcome family and friends as guests. Large ceremonies at convention centers or courthouses typically have designated seating areas for guests.

**Administrative Ceremonies**: Often smaller venues with limited space. Some administrative ceremonies do not allow guests, while others may permit one or two family members.

Check your ceremony notice (Form N-445) for specific instructions about guest attendance. If information is not provided, call the ceremony location to confirm the policy.

**Involving Children in the Ceremony**

If you have children who are under 18 and are Permanent Residents, they may automatically become citizens when you naturalize, depending on their situation:

**Automatic Citizenship Requirements (for children)**:
- At least one parent naturalizes
- Child is under 18 at time of parent's naturalization
- Child is a Permanent Resident
- Child resides in legal and physical custody of the naturalizing parent

Children who meet these requirements become citizens automatically upon your naturalization. However, they do not receive a Certificate of Naturalization at your ceremony. You must apply for a Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600) or US passport for them separately.

**What Family Members Will Experience**

Guests will:
- Go through security screening
- Sit in a designated guest area
- Watch the entire ceremony
- Hear the oath and welcome remarks
- See you receive your certificate
- Take photos after the ceremony concludes

**Photography and Recording**

| Activity | Typically Allowed | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Photos before ceremony | Yes | In lobby areas |
| Photos during ceremony | Sometimes | Flash photography often prohibited |
| Video recording | Varies | Some venues prohibit recording |
| Photos after ceremony | Yes | Designated photo areas often available |

**Making It a Family Celebration**

Many families make naturalization day a special occasion:
- Wear matching or color-coordinated outfits
- Plan a celebration meal at a favorite restaurant
- Take family photos at the venue
- Document the day for family history
- Include extended family via video call if they cannot attend

For Arab families, this day often represents the culmination of years of sacrifice and hard work. Celebrating with those who supported your journey acknowledges their contribution to your success.`

**Getting to Your Ceremony from Redlands**

Most Redlands residents are assigned to San Bernardino County or Riverside venues. Travel planning tips:

- **San Bernardino USCIS Office**: 15-20 minute drive via I-10 West
- **Ontario Convention Center**: 30-40 minute drive via I-10 West
- **Riverside Courthouse**: 25-30 minute drive via I-10 West and SR-91

Plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early. Account for potential traffic, especially for morning ceremonies when commute traffic is heavy.

**Parking Considerations**

- Arrive early for best parking options
- Some venues have paid parking ($10-20)
- Courthouses often have limited parking; consider parking garages nearby
- Large convention center ceremonies may fill parking lots quickly

**Public Transportation Options**

Omnitrans bus service connects Redlands to San Bernardino. Metrolink provides train service to Los Angeles and Riverside for ceremonies at those locations. Allow extra travel time if using public transportation.`

          content: `Your naturalization ceremony is a significant formal event. While there is no strict dress code, appropriate attire shows respect for the occasion and helps you look your best in photos you will treasure for years.

**Recommended Attire**

**For Men**:
- Business casual to business formal
- Dress pants or khakis with collared shirt
- Suit and tie for more formal impression
- Clean, closed-toe dress shoes

**For Women**:
- Business casual to business formal dress
- Dress pants or skirt with blouse
- Professional dress or suit
- Modest, comfortable heels or dress flats
- Hijab and modest dress are completely appropriate and welcome

**Attire to Avoid**

| Not Recommended | Reason |
|-----------------|--------|
| Shorts | Too casual for formal ceremony |
| Tank tops | Too casual |
| Flip-flops or sandals | May be prohibited in courthouses |
| T-shirts with logos | Too casual |
| Very casual jeans | Ceremony is a formal occasion |
| Anything with political statements | Keep the focus on citizenship |

**Cultural and Religious Attire**

American naturalization ceremonies welcome cultural diversity. You are absolutely free to wear:
- Traditional Arab formal attire
- Religious head coverings (hijab, kippah, etc.)
- Cultural jewelry and accessories
- Clothing representing your heritage

Many new citizens proudly wear attire from their home countries, reflecting both where they came from and their commitment to their new country.

**Practical Considerations**

**Comfort matters**: Ceremonies can last 2-3 hours. Choose comfortable shoes and clothing you can sit in for extended periods.

**Temperature**: Indoor venues often have strong air conditioning. Bring a light jacket or sweater even in summer.

**Layers**: You may move between outdoor heat and indoor cold, especially at summer ceremonies.

**Pockets**: Having pockets for your phone, tissues, and small items is convenient.

**Photography Planning**

Your naturalization photos will be treasured keepsakes. Consider:
- Colors that photograph well (avoid all-white or all-black)
- Jewelry you want visible in photos
- Hair styling that will last through a long event
- Makeup that withstands emotion (waterproof mascara)

Many families coordinate colors for group photos after the ceremony. Some new citizens bring a change of more casual clothes for celebration activities afterward.`

**Immediate Celebration After the Ceremony**

Many families plan activities for right after the ceremony:
- Family lunch or dinner at a favorite restaurant
- Photos at scenic locations (Redlands historic buildings, mountains)
- Visiting a meaningful location in your community
- Small gathering with close friends who supported your journey

**Larger Celebrations**

Some new citizens host gatherings to share the moment with their community:
- Home celebration with traditional food from your heritage
- Restaurant party with extended family and friends
- Backyard barbecue combining American and Arab cuisine
- Mosque or church celebration with faith community

**Meaningful Ways to Mark the Day**

| Activity | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Writing a letter to future generations | Document your immigration story |
| Creating a scrapbook | Preserve photos and documents from your journey |
| Planting a tree | Living symbol of your new roots |
| Charitable donation | Give back to organizations that helped immigrants |
| Video messages to family abroad | Share the moment with those who could not attend |

**Sharing with Family Abroad**

For many Arab immigrants, family members in Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Yemen, and other countries have supported and encouraged the journey to citizenship from afar. Technology makes sharing this moment possible:
- Video call during or after the ceremony
- Streaming the ceremony (where permitted)
- Sending photos and videos immediately after
- Planning a future visit to share the news in person

**Your Certificate of Naturalization Photo**

Your Certificate of Naturalization includes your photo, but many new citizens take additional photos:
- Holding the certificate with the American flag
- With family members at the venue
- At the ceremony entrance or with ceremony banners
- Professional photos scheduled after the ceremony

**Creating Family Traditions**

Some families mark citizenship anniversaries annually:
- Special dinner on the anniversary date
- Sharing the story with children each year
- Adding to a memory book each anniversary
- Volunteer work with immigrant-serving organizations

**Reflecting on Your Journey**

Take time to appreciate what you have accomplished. The path from immigrant to citizen often involves:
- Leaving your homeland
- Learning a new language
- Building a new career
- Raising children between two cultures
- Overcoming legal hurdles
- Persisting through years of waiting

You have demonstrated resilience, determination, and commitment. This achievement belongs to you and to everyone who supported you along the way.

**Looking Forward**

As you celebrate, you also look toward the future as an American citizen:
- Opportunities previously unavailable to you
- Full participation in American democracy
- The ability to sponsor family members for immigration
- Security and stability in your status
- The chance to give back to the country that welcomed you

Your citizenship is not an ending but a new beginning. The skills, perspective, and experience you bring as an immigrant strengthen America and enrich the communities where you live.`

          question: "What happens if I miss my scheduled citizenship ceremony?",
          answer: "If you miss your ceremony, contact USCIS immediately. You will need to send a letter explaining why you missed the ceremony and request rescheduling. Valid reasons include illness, family emergency, or circumstances beyond your control. USCIS will typically reschedule you for a future ceremony. However, missing without explanation can lead to your case being closed, requiring you to reapply for naturalization from the beginning. Do not miss your ceremony without notifying USCIS."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I travel outside the US between my interview approval and my ceremony?",
          answer: "Yes, you can travel after interview approval but before your ceremony. However, you must return in time for your scheduled ceremony. You also must report this travel on your N-445 questionnaire at the ceremony. Extended travel (over 6 months) or certain travel to specific countries could raise concerns. If your travel is longer than a few weeks, consult with an immigration attorney to ensure it will not affect your naturalization."
        },
        {
          question: "What if I get arrested between my interview and ceremony?",
          answer: "Any arrest, citation, or criminal charge between your interview and ceremony is extremely serious. You must answer truthfully on your N-445 questionnaire. Depending on the nature of the charge, USCIS may delay or deny your naturalization. Contact an immigration attorney immediately if you have any interaction with law enforcement. Even minor traffic tickets should be disclosed. Lying on the N-445 is grounds for denial and could affect future immigration benefits."
        },
        {
          question: "How soon after the ceremony can I apply for a passport?",
          answer: "You can apply for a US passport immediately after your ceremony. Many large ceremonies have passport acceptance facilities on-site. You will need your original Certificate of Naturalization, a passport photo, completed Form DS-11, payment, and valid ID. Your certificate will be mailed back to you after passport processing. Routine processing takes 6-8 weeks; expedited processing takes 2-3 weeks for an additional $60 fee."
        },
        {
          question: "My green card expired before my ceremony. Is that a problem?",
          answer: "An expired green card is not a problem for your naturalization ceremony. Your green card will be collected and destroyed regardless of whether it is expired or current. The expiration date does not affect your eligibility to complete the naturalization process. Simply bring the expired card to surrender at check-in. If you have lost your green card entirely, contact USCIS before your ceremony date to discuss your situation."
        },
        {
          question: "Can my children automatically become citizens when I naturalize?",
          answer: "Children under 18 who are Permanent Residents and live in your legal and physical custody may automatically become citizens when you naturalize. This applies to biological children, adopted children, and stepchildren in certain circumstances. However, they do not receive a Certificate of Naturalization at your ceremony. You must separately apply for a Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600) or US passport to document their citizenship status."
        },
        {
          question: "What if there is an error on my Certificate of Naturalization?",
          answer: "Check your certificate carefully before leaving the ceremony. If you notice any errors in your name, date of birth, or other information, report it immediately to a USCIS officer at the venue. Corrections made at the ceremony are much simpler than those made later. If you discover an error after leaving, you must file Form N-565 (Application for Replacement Naturalization/Citizenship Document) with supporting documentation, pay the $555 filing fee, and wait several months for correction."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I lose my citizenship from my home country when I become a US citizen?",
          answer: "The US allows dual citizenship and does not require you to renounce other citizenships. However, each country has its own rules. Some countries (like Egypt and Jordan) allow dual citizenship. Others may have restrictions or require specific procedures. Your country of origin's laws determine whether you keep that citizenship. The oath you take at naturalization includes renouncing allegiance to foreign powers, but this does not automatically revoke foreign citizenships. Research your specific country's rules or consult with an attorney."

      introduction: `بعد أشهر أو سنوات من التحضير والمقابلات والانتظار، تلقيت أخيراً الخبر الذي كنت تأمله: تمت الموافقة على طلب التجنس الخاص بك. الآن تأتي الخطوة الأخيرة والأكثر أهمية في رحلتك لتصبح مواطناً أمريكياً - حفل قسم الولاء. بالنسبة لسكان ريدلاندز والمجتمعات المحيطة في إنلاند إمباير، فإن فهم ما يمكن توقعه في حفل المواطنة سيساعدك على الاستعداد لهذه المناسبة المهمة وضمان سير كل شيء بسلاسة في اليوم الذي تصبح فيه رسمياً مواطناً أمريكياً.

حفل التجنس هو أكثر من مجرد إجراء قانوني رسمي. إنه احتفال بإنجازك، واعتراف بالتزامك تجاه بلدك الجديد، وبداية فصل جديد في حياتك. يصف العديد من المتقدمين الحفل بأنه تجربة عاطفية وتحويلية، محاطين بمهاجرين آخرين من جميع أنحاء العالم عملوا جميعاً بجد للوصول إلى هذه اللحظة نفسها. سيرشدك هذا الدليل الشامل خلال كل جانب من جوانب حفل المواطنة، من الاستعدادات العملية إلى فهم أهمية القسم الذي ستؤديه.

في مجموعة داليا القانونية، ساعدنا آلاف المهاجرين في ريدلاندز وسان برناردينو وجميع أنحاء جنوب كاليفورنيا على إكمال رحلة التجنس. نحن نفهم الأسئلة والمخاوف التي تنشأ مع اقتراب موعد الحفل، ونحن هنا لضمان شعورك بالاستعداد الكامل والثقة في هذا اليوم المميز.`,

          title: "ما الذي يحدث في حفل المواطنة",
          content: `حفل التجنس هو حدث منظم بعناية مصمم للترحيب بالمواطنين الجدد في المجتمع الأمريكي. فهم ما سيحدث في كل مرحلة يساعدك على الشعور بالاستعداد ويتيح لك تقدير أهمية المناسبة بالكامل.

**قبل بدء الحفل**

يجب أن تصل قبل 30 دقيقة على الأقل من موعد الحفل المحدد. عند الوصول، ستمر بفحص أمني مشابه لفحص المطار. سيقوم موظفو USCIS بعد ذلك بتسجيلك من خلال التحقق من هويتك وجمع بطاقة الإقامة الدائمة (البطاقة الخضراء). تأكد من أن بطاقتك الخضراء في متناول اليد بسهولة، حيث يجب تسليمها أثناء التسجيل.

بعد التسجيل، ستتلقى مواد تشمل علماً أمريكياً صغيراً للتلويح به أثناء الحفل وحزم معلومات حول التسجيل للتصويت وتقديم طلب للحصول على جواز سفر وحقوقك ومسؤولياتك كمواطن.

**برنامج الحفل**

تتبع معظم حفلات التجنس نمطاً مشابهاً:

| عنصر الحفل | المدة | الوصف |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| التسجيل والجلوس | 30-45 دقيقة | التحقق من الهوية وجمع البطاقة الخضراء |
| الملاحظات الافتتاحية | 5-10 دقائق | ترحيب من مسؤول USCIS أو المسؤول المترأس |
| الخطاب الرئيسي | 10-15 دقيقة | غالباً ما يلقيه شخصية محلية بارزة أو قاضٍ أو مواطن مميز |
| نداء الأمم | 5-10 دقائق | يتم الإعلان عن بلدان الأصل، وتقف عندما يُنادى على بلدك |
| قسم الولاء | 5 دقائق | الجزء الأهم حيث تصبح رسمياً مواطناً |
| قسم الولاء للعلم | دقيقتان | أول مرة تردد فيها القسم كمواطن أمريكي |
| النشيد الوطني | 3 دقائق | غالباً ما يُغنى من قبل مؤدٍ محلي أو يُعزف كتسجيل |
| توزيع الشهادات | 30-60 دقيقة | تتلقى شهادة التجنس الخاصة بك |
| الملاحظات الختامية | 5 دقائق | التهنئة النهائية والانصراف |

**التأثير العاطفي**

يصف العديد من المواطنين الجدد الحفل بأنه عاطفي بشكل مفاجئ. سماع أسماء عشرات البلدان تُنادى يذكرك بأنك جزء من تقليد طويل من المهاجرين الذين بنوا أمريكا. عندما تقف مع آخرين من بلدك الأصلي - سواء كانت سوريا أو مصر أو العراق أو الأردن أو لبنان أو اليمن أو أي دولة أخرى - تشعر بالارتباط بمن خاضوا رحلات مماثلة.

اللحظة التي يعلن فيها المسؤول المترأس أنك مواطن أمريكي غالباً ما تجلب الدموع حتى لأولئك الذين توقعوا أن يظلوا متماسكين. هذا إنجاز مهم يستحق الاعتراف العاطفي.`

          title: "الحفلات في نفس اليوم مقابل الحفلات المجدولة",
          content: `تقدم USCIS نوعين من حفلات التجنس، وفهم الفرق يساعدك على التخطيط بشكل مناسب.

**الحفلات الإدارية في نفس اليوم**

تقدم بعض مكاتب USCIS الميدانية حفلات قسم في نفس اليوم فوراً بعد مقابلة التجنس إذا تمت الموافقة عليك. يتم إجراء هذه الحفلات الإدارية من قبل موظفي USCIS بدلاً من القضاة.

مزايا حفلات نفس اليوم:
- إكمال العملية بأكملها في زيارة واحدة
- لا انتظار إضافي بعد الموافقة
- ملائمة لمن سافروا بعيداً لمقابلتهم
- تصبح مواطناً في نفس اليوم الذي تجتاز فيه مقابلتك

عيوب حفلات نفس اليوم:
- أجواء أقل رسمية
- مجموعات أصغر من المواطنين الجدد
- قد لا يتمكن أفراد العائلة من الحضور
- وقت أقل للتحضير عاطفياً

**الحفلات القضائية المجدولة**

إذا لم يكن حفل نفس اليوم متاحاً أو كنت تفضل حدثاً أكثر رسمية، فسيتم جدولتك لحفل قضائي في تاريخ لاحق. تُعقد هذه الحفلات عادةً في المحاكم الفيدرالية أو مراكز المؤتمرات أو الأماكن الكبيرة الأخرى ويترأسها قضاة فيدراليون.

مزايا الحفلات المجدولة:
- أجواء أكثر رسمية ولا تُنسى
- غالباً مئات المواطنين الجدد يؤدون القسم معاً
- يمكن للعائلة والأصدقاء الحضور
- وقت للتحضير ودعوة الأحباء
- أحياناً تُعقد في مواقع تاريخية أو ذات أهمية

**مواقع الحفلات بالقرب من ريدلاندز**

| الموقع | النوع | السعة النموذجية | المسافة من ريدلاندز |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| مكتب USCIS سان برناردينو | إداري | 25-50 | 8 أميال |
| محكمة ريفرسايد الفيدرالية | قضائي | 100-200 | 15 ميلاً |
| مركز لوس أنجلوس للمؤتمرات | قضائي | 3,000-7,000 | 60 ميلاً |
| بومونا فيربلكس | قضائي | 500-1,000 | 35 ميلاً |
| مركز أونتاريو للمؤتمرات | قضائي | 500-1,000 | 25 ميلاً |

عموماً لا يمكنك اختيار نوع الحفل أو موقعه. تعينك USCIS بناءً على جدولها ومكتب معالجة طلبك. ومع ذلك، إذا كان لديك سبب مقنع لطلب تاريخ أو موقع حفل مختلف، يمكنك الاتصال بـ USCIS، على الرغم من أن مثل هذه الطلبات نادراً ما تُمنح.`
        },
        {
          title: "ما يجب إحضاره إلى حفل المواطنة",
          content: `الاستعداد الصحيح يضمن سير الحفل بسلاسة ومغادرتك بجميع المستندات اللازمة.

**العناصر المطلوبة - يجب إحضارها**

خطاب إشعار الحفل (نموذج N-445) ضروري للغاية. تم إرسال هذه الوثيقة إليك بالبريد بعد الموافقة على مقابلتك وتحتوي على تاريخ ووقت وموقع الحفل. لا يمكنك المشاركة في الحفل بدونه.

يجب تسليم بطاقة الإقامة الدائمة (البطاقة الخضراء) عند التسجيل. تجمع USCIS البطاقات الخضراء لأنك لن تحتاج إلى وضع الإقامة الدائمة بمجرد أن تصبح مواطناً. إذا فقدت بطاقتك الخضراء، اتصل بـ USCIS قبل موعد الحفل.

مطلوب بطاقة هوية صالحة صادرة عن الحكومة مع صورة (رخصة قيادة أو بطاقة هوية الولاية أو جواز سفر من بلدك الأصلي) للتحقق من الهوية.

**إكمال استبيان N-445**

يحتوي ظهر نموذج N-445 على أسئلة يجب الإجابة عليها بصدق قبل أداء القسم. هذه الأسئلة تسأل عما إذا كان أي شيء قد تغير منذ مقابلتك، بما في ذلك:

- هل سافرت خارج الولايات المتحدة؟
- هل تزوجت أو طلقت؟
- هل تم القبض عليك أو وجهت إليك أي تهمة جنائية؟
- هل غيرت عنوانك؟
- هل انضممت إلى أي منظمات؟

يجب الإجابة على هذه الأسئلة في الحفل والتوقيع على النموذج أمام موظف USCIS. إذا أجبت بـ "نعم" على أي سؤال، قد يُطلب منك التنحي جانباً لاستجواب إضافي قبل السماح لك بالمشاركة في الحفل.

**العناصر الموصى بإحضارها**

| العنصر | الغرض |
|--------|--------|
| زجاجة ماء (فارغة، لملئها بعد الأمن) | يمكن أن تكون الحفلات طويلة، خاصة في الصيف |
| وجبة خفيفة | الحفاظ على مستوى السكر في الدم أثناء فترات الانتظار |
| مادة للقراءة | التسلية أثناء فترات الانتظار |
| هاتف مع كاميرا | صور مع العائلة بعد الحفل |
| مناديل | يصبح كثير من الناس عاطفيين أثناء القسم |
| سترة أو جاكيت | يمكن أن يكون تكييف المكان بارداً |
| قلم | إكمال الأوراق |

**العناصر التي يجب تركها في المنزل**

لا تحضر أسلحة من أي نوع، بما في ذلك سكاكين الجيب. قد تبطئ الحقائب الكبيرة فحص الأمن. بينما يُسمح بالهواتف، كن مستعداً لكتمها أثناء الحفل.`
        },
        {
          title: "فهم قسم الولاء",
          content: `قسم الولاء هو الآلية القانونية التي تصبح بها مواطناً أمريكياً. فهم كل عبارة يساعدك على تقدير الالتزامات التي تتعهد بها.

**النص الكامل للقسم**

"أعلن بموجب هذا، تحت القسم، أنني أتخلى تماماً وكلياً عن كل ولاء وإخلاص لأي أمير أو حاكم أو دولة أو سيادة أجنبية، كنت حتى الآن رعية أو مواطناً لها؛ وأنني سأدعم وأدافع عن دستور وقوانين الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية ضد جميع الأعداء، الأجانب والمحليين؛ وأنني سأحمل إيماناً وولاءً صادقين لنفسه؛ وأنني سأحمل السلاح نيابة عن الولايات المتحدة عندما يتطلب القانون ذلك؛ وأنني سأؤدي خدمة غير قتالية في القوات المسلحة للولايات المتحدة عندما يتطلب القانون ذلك؛ وأنني سأؤدي عملاً ذا أهمية وطنية تحت إشراف مدني عندما يتطلب القانون ذلك؛ وأنني أتحمل هذا الالتزام بحرية، دون أي تحفظ عقلي أو غرض للتهرب؛ فليساعدني الله."

**فهم كل عنصر**

يحتوي القسم على عدة وعود متميزة:

**التخلي عن الولاءات الأجنبية**: أنت تتعهد بالولاء الأساسي للولايات المتحدة. ومع ذلك، هذا لا يلغي تلقائياً جنسيتك السابقة. العديد من الدول، بما في ذلك بعض الدول العربية، لديها قواعدها الخاصة بشأن الجنسية المزدوجة التي لا تتأثر بالقسم الأمريكي.

**دعم الدستور والدفاع عنه**: تتعهد بالتمسك بالقوانين الأمريكية ومبادئ الدستور، بما في ذلك حرية التعبير والدين وغيرها من الحقوق.

**حمل السلاح إذا لزم الأمر**: توافق على الخدمة في الجيش إذا كان القانون يتطلب ذلك. ومع ذلك، هذا لا يعني أنه سيتم تجنيدك، ولم يكن لدى الولايات المتحدة خدمة عسكرية إلزامية منذ عام 1973.

**الخدمة غير القتالية**: إذا كنت لا تستطيع حمل السلاح بسبب اعتراضات دينية أو أخلاقية، توافق على الخدمة في أدوار غير قتالية.

**العمل ذو الأهمية الوطنية**: توافق على المساهمة في احتياجات الأمة أثناء حالات الطوارئ.

**القسم المعدل للمعترضين دينياً أو ضميرياً**

إذا كانت معتقداتك الدينية أو قناعاتك الأخلاقية تمنعك من أداء أجزاء معينة من القسم، يمكنك طلب نسخة معدلة تحذف الإشارات إلى حمل السلاح أو الخدمة غير القتالية أو عبارة "فليساعدني الله". يجب أن تكون قد ناقشت هذا مع USCIS أثناء مقابلتك إذا كان ذلك ينطبق.

**أداء القسم**

في الحفل، يقف الجميع ويرفعون يدهم اليمنى. يقرأ المسؤول المترأس القسم في أجزاء، وتكرر كل جزء. تحدث بوضوح وبصوت مسموع. هذا ليس اختباراً - لن ترسب لنطق الكلمات بشكل خاطئ. الشيء المهم هو التزامك الصادق بالكلمات التي تنطقها.

لحظة انتهاء القسم، تصبح قانونياً مواطناً أمريكياً. كل ما يلي - استلام شهادتك، الترحيب بك كمواطن - هو احتفالي. القسم نفسه هو التحول القانوني.`

          title: "تغيير الاسم في حفل التجنس",
          content: `تقدم عملية التجنس فرصة فريدة لتغيير اسمك بشكل قانوني دون المرور بإجراءات محكمة منفصلة. فهم خياراتك يساعدك على اتخاذ القرار الصحيح لوضعك.

**متى يتم التعامل مع تغييرات الاسم**

إذا طلبت تغيير الاسم في طلب N-400 الخاص بك، يمكن للقاضي المترأس في حفل قضائي تغيير اسمك قانونياً كجزء من إجراءات التجنس. عادةً لا تستطيع الحفلات الإدارية التي يجريها موظفو USCIS معالجة تغييرات الاسم.

**أنواع تغييرات الاسم المتاحة**

| نوع التغيير | مثال | ملاحظات |
|-------------|------|---------|
| تأنجل اسمك | محمد إلى مايكل | شائع بين المهاجرين الذين يسعون لسهولة النطق |
| تبني لقب الزوج/ة | الاحتفاظ باسم العائلة إلى إضافة اسم الزواج | لمن تزوجوا خلال فترة البطاقة الخضراء |
| تصحيح الإملاء | إصلاح أخطاء النقل الحرفي | من العربية إلى الإنجليزية، غالباً ما تُكتب الأسماء بشكل غير متسق |
| إزالة أو إضافة أسماء وسطى | إضافة أسماء العائلة أو إزالة أسماء غير مرغوبة | يعكس التفضيلات الثقافية |
| تبني اسم أمريكي بالكامل | عبدالله الحسن إلى أنتوني هاريسون | تحول كامل |

**اعتبارات للمهاجرين العرب**

غالباً ما تواجه الأسماء العربية تحديات في النقل الحرفي عند تحويلها إلى أحرف إنجليزية. قد يُكتب اسمك بشكل مختلف في مستندات مختلفة (جواز السفر، شهادة الميلاد، البطاقة الخضراء). حفل التجنس هو فرصة لتوحيد إملاء اسمك.

يختار بعض المتقدمين الاحتفاظ باسمهم العربي كما هو مكتوب بالضبط على بطاقتهم الخضراء، محافظين على هويتهم الثقافية. يفضل آخرون تبني أسماء يسهل على الأمريكيين نطقها، مما قد يقلل من التمييز في التوظيف أو المواقف الاجتماعية. لا يوجد اختيار صحيح أو خاطئ - إنه قرار شخصي.

**إذا لم تطلب تغيير الاسم لكنك تريده**

إذا لم تطلب تغيير الاسم في طلب N-400 الأصلي لكنك قررت منذ ذلك الحين أنك تريد واحداً، قد يكون قد فات الأوان لحفلك المجدول. ستحتاج إلى:

1. الاتصال بـ USCIS لمناقشة الخيارات قبل موعد الحفل
2. في بعض الحالات، المرور بعملية تغيير اسم قانونية منفصلة بعد التجنس

**بعد تغيير الاسم**

إذا تم تغيير اسمك أثناء الحفل، ستُظهر شهادة التجنس اسمك القانوني الجديد. يجب عليك بعد ذلك تحديث:

- إدارة الضمان الاجتماعي
- إدارة المركبات الآلية للولاية لرخصة القيادة
- جواز السفر (تقديم الطلب بالاسم الجديد)
- الحسابات المصرفية
- سجلات التوظيف
- سندات الملكية
- بطاقات الائتمان
- وثائق التأمين

احتفظ بشهادة التجنس بأمان، حيث إنها دليلك على كل من المواطنة وتغيير الاسم القانوني.`

**ما تحتويه الشهادة**

تتضمن شهادة التجنس الخاصة بك:

- اسمك القانوني الكامل (بما في ذلك أي تغيير في الاسم)
- صورتك
- تاريخ ميلادك
- بلد الجنسية السابقة
- تاريخ حصولك على المواطنة
- رقم الشهادة (معرف فريد)
- توقيعات وختم مسؤولي USCIS

**استلام شهادتك في الحفل**

بعد القسم، يتم توزيع الشهادات. قد يستغرق هذا من 30 دقيقة إلى أكثر من ساعة حسب حجم الحفل. سيُنادى على اسمك، أو ستتقدم في صف منظم. عندما تتلقى شهادتك:

1. **تحقق من جميع المعلومات فوراً** - تحقق من إملاء اسمك وتاريخ ميلادك وصورتك
2. **أبلغ عن أي أخطاء قبل المغادرة** - التصحيحات أسهل بكثير في الحفل من لاحقاً
3. **وقّع على الشهادة** - يجب التوقيع في المنطقة المخصصة
4. **احتفظ بها في المجلد الواقي** - لا تطوِ الشهادة أو تغلفها أو تتلفها

**إذا كانت هناك أخطاء في شهادتك**

| نوع الخطأ | الإجراء المطلوب |
|-----------|-----------------|
| اسم مكتوب بشكل خاطئ | أبلغ فوراً؛ اطلب نموذج تصحيح |
| تاريخ ميلاد خاطئ | أبلغ فوراً؛ قد يؤخر المغادرة |
| مشاكل في الصورة | أبلغ فوراً |
| أخطاء كتابية طفيفة | قد يتم تصحيحها في الحفل أو من خلال طلب N-565 |
| أخطاء كبيرة | قد تتطلب موعد حفل جديد |

**حماية شهادتك**

شهادة التجنس الخاصة بك لا يمكن استبدالها في شكلها الأصلي. بينما يمكنك الحصول على بديل من خلال نموذج N-565 (رسوم تقديم 555 دولاراً)، تستغرق العملية أشهراً وتخلق تعقيدات غير ضرورية.

توصيات التخزين:
- احتفظ بالأصل في خزنة مقاومة للحريق أو صندوق أمانات
- اصنع نسخاً ملونة عالية الجودة لسجلاتك
- امسح نسخة رقمية مخزنة بشكل آمن في التخزين السحابي
- لا تحمل الأصل إلا إذا كان ذلك ضرورياً للغاية

**متى ستحتاج إلى شهادتك**

- تقديم طلب للحصول على جواز سفر أمريكي
- التسجيل للتصويت
- إثبات المواطنة للتوظيف (نموذج I-9)
- رعاية أفراد الأسرة للهجرة
- بعض الوظائف الحكومية التي تتطلب التحقق من المواطنة
- الحصول على تصاريح أمنية

**تسجيل الناخبين في الحفل**

معظم حفلات التجنس لديها طاولات تسجيل ناخبين يديرها مسؤولو الانتخابات المحليون أو منظمات غير حزبية. يمكنك التسجيل فوراً بعد استلام شهادتك.

المعلومات المطلوبة للتسجيل:
- شهادة التجنس الجديدة (لإثبات المواطنة)
- العنوان الحالي في ريدلاندز أو مدينتك في كاليفورنيا
- تاريخ الميلاد
- رقم رخصة القيادة أو بطاقة الهوية في كاليفورنيا (إذا كان لديك)
- آخر أربعة أرقام من رقم الضمان الاجتماعي

**فهم تسجيل الناخبين في كاليفورنيا**

| طريقة التسجيل | الجدول الزمني | ملاحظات |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| نفس اليوم في الحفل | فوري | غالباً متاح في الحفلات |
| عبر الإنترنت على registertovote.ca.gov | 15 يوماً قبل الانتخابات | يتطلب رخصة قيادة أو بطاقة هوية CA |
| بالبريد | 15 يوماً قبل الانتخابات | النموذج متاح في مكاتب البريد والمكتبات |
| التسجيل المشروط | حتى يوم الانتخابات وبما في ذلك | متاح في مكتب انتخابات المقاطعة |

**خيارات الانتماء الحزبي**

عند التسجيل في كاليفورنيا، تختار انتماءً حزبياً أو لا تفضيل حزبي:
- الحزب الديمقراطي
- الحزب الجمهوري
- حزب أمريكان إندبندنت (ليس نفس "مستقل")
- حزب الخضر
- الحزب التحرري
- حزب السلام والحرية
- لا تفضيل حزبي

اختيار "لا تفضيل حزبي" يعني أنك ناخب مستقل. في الانتخابات التمهيدية في كاليفورنيا، قد لا تزال تصوت في بعض الانتخابات التمهيدية للأحزاب حسب قواعد الحزب.

**انتخاباتك الأولى**

كمواطن جديد، يمكنك التصويت في:
- الانتخابات الفيدرالية (الرئيس، مجلس الشيوخ الأمريكي، مجلس النواب الأمريكي)
- انتخابات الولاية (الحاكم، الهيئة التشريعية للولاية، إجراءات اقتراع الولاية)
- الانتخابات المحلية (رئيس البلدية، مجلس المدينة، مجلس المدرسة، الإجراءات المحلية)
- الانتخابات الخاصة

**المسؤولية المدنية والمشاركة**

التصويت هو إحدى طرق المشاركة في الديمقراطية الأمريكية. كمواطن متجنس، يمكنك أيضاً:
- الخدمة في هيئات المحلفين (قد يتم استدعاؤك لخدمة المحلفين)
- الترشح لمعظم المناصب المنتخبة
- المشاركة في اجتماعات المجتمع والحكومة المحلية
- الاتصال بممثليك المنتخبين بشأن القضايا التي تهمك

يجد العديد من المهاجرين العرب أن المشاركة في السياسة المحلية هي طريقة فعالة للدفاع عن مجتمعهم وضمان سماع أصواتهم في القضايا التي تؤثر على أسر المهاجرين.`

          title: "تقديم طلب للحصول على جواز سفرك الأمريكي",
          content: `مع تأكيد مواطنتك، يمكنك الآن تقديم طلب للحصول على جواز سفر أمريكي. يجعل العديد من المواطنين الجدد هذا أولويتهم الأولى، خاصة أولئك الذين يريدون السفر أو يحتاجون إلى دليل إضافي على المواطنة.

**متى تتقدم بطلب للحصول على جواز سفرك**

يمكنك التقدم بطلب للحصول على جواز سفر فوراً بعد حفل التجنس. العديد من الحفلات الكبيرة لديها مرافق قبول جوازات السفر في الموقع، مما يتيح لك تقديم طلبك في نفس اليوم. وإلا، يمكنك التقديم في:

- مكاتب البريد التي تقبل طلبات جوازات السفر
- مرافق قبول جوازات السفر
- وكالات جوازات السفر الإقليمية (للسفر العاجل)

**متطلبات طلب جواز السفر**

| المستند/العنصر | الغرض | ملاحظات |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| شهادة التجنس (الأصلية) | إثبات المواطنة | تُعاد بالبريد بعد المعالجة |
| صورة جواز السفر (2×2 بوصة) | التحقق من الهوية | تنطبق متطلبات محددة |
| نموذج DS-11 المكتمل | نموذج الطلب | يجب إكماله شخصياً للمتقدمين لأول مرة |
| الدفع (165 دولاراً إجمالياً لدفتر جواز سفر البالغين) | رسوم المعالجة | يشمل رسوم القبول 35 دولاراً |
| هوية صالحة | التحقق من الهوية | رخصة قيادة أو بطاقة هوية الولاية |

**أوقات معالجة جواز السفر**

| نوع الخدمة | وقت المعالجة | التكلفة الإجمالية (الدفتر) |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| عادي | 6-8 أسابيع | 165 دولاراً |
| معجل | 2-3 أسابيع | 225 دولاراً |
| عاجل (موعد في الوكالة) | نفس اليوم إلى أسبوعين | 225 دولاراً + السفر إلى الوكالة |

**بطاقة جواز السفر مقابل دفتر جواز السفر**

بطاقة جواز السفر (65 دولاراً) صالحة فقط للسفر البري والبحري إلى كندا والمكسيك ومنطقة البحر الكاريبي وبرمودا. للسفر الجوي إلى أي مكان أو السفر خارج أمريكا الشمالية، تحتاج إلى دفتر جواز السفر. يتقدم معظم المواطنين الجدد للحصول على الدفتر، والكثيرون يحصلون على كليهما للراحة.

**اعتبارات السفر للمواطنين الجدد**

أثناء معالجة طلب جواز سفرك، يمكن أن تعمل شهادة التجنس كدليل على المواطنة للأغراض المحلية. ومع ذلك، لا يمكنك استخدامها للسفر الدولي. خطط لرحلتك الدولية الأولى بعد استلام جواز سفرك.

**اعتبارات الجنسية المزدوجة**

تسمح الولايات المتحدة بالجنسية المزدوجة. امتلاك جواز سفر أمريكي لا يتطلب التنازل عن جنسيات أو جوازات سفر أخرى. ومع ذلك، عند دخول ومغادرة الولايات المتحدة، يجب استخدام جواز سفرك الأمريكي. قد يُستخدم جواز(ات) سفرك الأخرى للسفر إلى بلدك الأصلي إذا كان ذلك البلد يعترف أيضاً بالجنسية المزدوجة.

بعض الدول العربية لديها قواعد محددة حول الجنسية المزدوجة:
- بعض الدول تلغي المواطنة تلقائياً عند التجنس في مكان آخر
- بعضها يتطلب منك التنازل أو قد لا يعترف بجنسيتك الأمريكية
- بعضها يقبل الجنسية المزدوجة بالكامل

ابحث عن قواعد بلدك الأصلي، واستشر محامي هجرة إذا كانت لديك أسئلة حول الحفاظ على الوضع المزدوج.`

          title: "إحضار أفراد العائلة إلى الحفل",
          content: `حفل التجنس الخاص بك هو إنجاز يستحق المشاركة مع الأحباء. فهم السياسات وفرص مشاركة العائلة يساعدك على التخطيط وفقاً لذلك.

**سياسات حضور العائلة**

**الحفلات القضائية**: عموماً ترحب بالعائلة والأصدقاء كضيوف. الحفلات الكبيرة في مراكز المؤتمرات أو المحاكم عادةً لديها مناطق جلوس مخصصة للضيوف.

**الحفلات الإدارية**: غالباً أماكن أصغر مع مساحة محدودة. بعض الحفلات الإدارية لا تسمح بالضيوف، بينما قد يسمح البعض الآخر بفرد أو اثنين من أفراد العائلة.

تحقق من إشعار الحفل (نموذج N-445) للحصول على تعليمات محددة حول حضور الضيوف. إذا لم تُقدم معلومات، اتصل بموقع الحفل لتأكيد السياسة.

**إشراك الأطفال في الحفل**

إذا كان لديك أطفال دون 18 عاماً وهم مقيمون دائمون، قد يصبحون مواطنين تلقائياً عندما تتجنس، حسب وضعهم:

**متطلبات المواطنة التلقائية (للأطفال)**:
- أحد الوالدين على الأقل يتجنس
- الطفل دون 18 عاماً وقت تجنس الوالد
- الطفل مقيم دائم
- الطفل يقيم في الحضانة القانونية والفعلية للوالد المتجنس

الأطفال الذين يستوفون هذه المتطلبات يصبحون مواطنين تلقائياً عند تجنسك. ومع ذلك، لا يتلقون شهادة التجنس في حفلك. يجب عليك التقدم بطلب منفصل للحصول على شهادة المواطنة (نموذج N-600) أو جواز سفر أمريكي لهم.

**ما سيختبره أفراد العائلة**

سيقوم الضيوف بـ:
- المرور بفحص أمني
- الجلوس في منطقة ضيوف مخصصة
- مشاهدة الحفل بأكمله
- سماع القسم وملاحظات الترحيب
- رؤيتك تستلم شهادتك
- التقاط الصور بعد انتهاء الحفل

**التصوير والتسجيل**

| النشاط | مسموح عادةً | ملاحظات |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| صور قبل الحفل | نعم | في مناطق الردهة |
| صور أثناء الحفل | أحياناً | التصوير بالفلاش غالباً ممنوع |
| تسجيل فيديو | يختلف | بعض الأماكن تمنع التسجيل |
| صور بعد الحفل | نعم | غالباً تتوفر مناطق تصوير مخصصة |

**جعلها احتفالاً عائلياً**

تجعل العديد من العائلات يوم التجنس مناسبة خاصة:
- ارتداء ملابس متناسقة أو منسقة الألوان
- التخطيط لوجبة احتفالية في مطعم مفضل
- التقاط صور عائلية في المكان
- توثيق اليوم لتاريخ العائلة
- إشراك العائلة الممتدة عبر مكالمة فيديو إذا لم يتمكنوا من الحضور

للعائلات العربية، غالباً ما يمثل هذا اليوم تتويجاً لسنوات من التضحية والعمل الشاق. الاحتفال مع من دعموا رحلتك يعترف بمساهمتهم في نجاحك.`

**الوصول إلى الحفل من ريدلاندز**

يتم تعيين معظم سكان ريدلاندز في أماكن مقاطعة سان برناردينو أو ريفرسايد. نصائح التخطيط للسفر:

- **مكتب USCIS سان برناردينو**: 15-20 دقيقة بالسيارة عبر I-10 غرباً
- **مركز أونتاريو للمؤتمرات**: 30-40 دقيقة بالسيارة عبر I-10 غرباً
- **محكمة ريفرسايد**: 25-30 دقيقة بالسيارة عبر I-10 غرباً وSR-91

خطط للوصول قبل 30 دقيقة على الأقل. احسب حساب حركة المرور المحتملة، خاصة للحفلات الصباحية عندما تكون حركة التنقل كثيفة.

**اعتبارات موقف السيارات**

- صل مبكراً للحصول على أفضل خيارات موقف السيارات
- بعض الأماكن لديها موقف مدفوع (10-20 دولاراً)
- المحاكم غالباً لديها موقف محدود؛ فكر في مرائب قريبة
- حفلات مراكز المؤتمرات الكبيرة قد تملأ مواقف السيارات بسرعة

**خيارات النقل العام**

خدمة حافلات Omnitrans تربط ريدلاندز بسان برناردينو. يوفر Metrolink خدمة القطار إلى لوس أنجلوس وريفرسايد للحفلات في تلك المواقع. اسمح بوقت سفر إضافي إذا كنت تستخدم وسائل النقل العام.`

          title: "ما يجب ارتداؤه في حفل المواطنة",
          content: `حفل التجنس الخاص بك هو حدث رسمي مهم. بينما لا يوجد قواعد لباس صارمة، الملابس المناسبة تُظهر الاحترام للمناسبة وتساعدك على الظهور بأفضل مظهر في الصور التي ستعتز بها لسنوات.

**الملابس الموصى بها**

**للرجال**:
- من عمل عادي إلى رسمي
- بنطال رسمي أو كاكي مع قميص بياقة
- بدلة وربطة عنق لانطباع أكثر رسمية
- حذاء رسمي نظيف مغلق

**للنساء**:
- من عمل عادي إلى رسمي
- بنطال رسمي أو تنورة مع بلوزة
- فستان مهني أو بدلة
- كعب متواضع ومريح أو حذاء مسطح رسمي
- الحجاب والملابس المحتشمة مناسبة تماماً ومرحب بها

**الملابس التي يجب تجنبها**

| غير موصى به | السبب |
|------------|--------|
| شورتات | غير رسمي جداً للحفل الرسمي |
| قمصان بدون أكمام | غير رسمي جداً |
| شباشب أو صنادل | قد تكون ممنوعة في المحاكم |
| تيشيرتات بشعارات | غير رسمي جداً |
| جينز عادي جداً | الحفل مناسبة رسمية |
| أي شيء بتصريحات سياسية | حافظ على التركيز على المواطنة |

**الملابس الثقافية والدينية**

حفلات التجنس الأمريكية ترحب بالتنوع الثقافي. أنت حر تماماً في ارتداء:
- الملابس الرسمية العربية التقليدية
- أغطية الرأس الدينية (الحجاب، الكيباه، إلخ)
- المجوهرات والإكسسوارات الثقافية
- ملابس تمثل تراثك

يرتدي العديد من المواطنين الجدد بفخر ملابس من بلدانهم الأصلية، مما يعكس كلاً من أصولهم والتزامهم تجاه بلدهم الجديد.

**اعتبارات عملية**

**الراحة مهمة**: يمكن أن تستمر الحفلات 2-3 ساعات. اختر أحذية مريحة وملابس يمكنك الجلوس فيها لفترات طويلة.

**درجة الحرارة**: الأماكن الداخلية غالباً لديها تكييف قوي. أحضر جاكيت خفيف أو سترة حتى في الصيف.

**الطبقات**: قد تتنقل بين الحرارة الخارجية والبرودة الداخلية، خاصة في حفلات الصيف.

**الجيوب**: وجود جيوب لهاتفك والمناديل والأغراض الصغيرة مريح.

**التخطيط للتصوير**

صور التجنس الخاصة بك ستكون ذكريات عزيزة. فكر في:
- ألوان تبدو جيدة في الصور (تجنب الأبيض الكامل أو الأسود الكامل)
- مجوهرات تريد أن تكون مرئية في الصور
- تسريحة شعر تستمر خلال حدث طويل
- مكياج يتحمل العاطفة (ماسكارا مقاومة للماء)

تنسق العديد من العائلات الألوان للصور الجماعية بعد الحفل. يحضر بعض المواطنين الجدد تغييراً لملابس أكثر راحة لأنشطة الاحتفال بعد ذلك.`

**أفكار للاحتفال**

**الاحتفال الفوري بعد الحفل**

تخطط العديد من العائلات لأنشطة مباشرة بعد الحفل:
- غداء أو عشاء عائلي في مطعم مفضل
- صور في مواقع خلابة (مباني ريدلاندز التاريخية، الجبال)
- زيارة موقع ذي معنى في مجتمعك
- تجمع صغير مع الأصدقاء المقربين الذين دعموا رحلتك

**احتفالات أكبر**

يستضيف بعض المواطنين الجدد تجمعات لمشاركة اللحظة مع مجتمعهم:
- احتفال منزلي مع طعام تقليدي من تراثك
- حفلة في مطعم مع العائلة الممتدة والأصدقاء
- شواء في الفناء الخلفي يجمع بين المأكولات الأمريكية والعربية
- احتفال في المسجد أو الكنيسة مع مجتمع الإيمان

**طرق ذات معنى لتخليد اليوم**

| النشاط | الغرض |
|--------|--------|
| كتابة رسالة للأجيال القادمة | توثيق قصة هجرتك |
| إنشاء ألبوم صور | حفظ الصور والوثائق من رحلتك |
| زراعة شجرة | رمز حي لجذورك الجديدة |
| تبرع خيري | رد الجميل للمنظمات التي ساعدت المهاجرين |
| رسائل فيديو للعائلة في الخارج | مشاركة اللحظة مع من لم يتمكنوا من الحضور |

**المشاركة مع العائلة في الخارج**

بالنسبة للعديد من المهاجرين العرب، دعم وشجع أفراد العائلة في سوريا ومصر ولبنان والأردن والعراق واليمن ودول أخرى الرحلة إلى المواطنة من بعيد. التكنولوجيا تجعل مشاركة هذه اللحظة ممكنة:
- مكالمة فيديو أثناء أو بعد الحفل
- بث الحفل (حيث يُسمح)
- إرسال الصور ومقاطع الفيديو فوراً بعد
- التخطيط لزيارة مستقبلية لمشاركة الخبر شخصياً

**صورة شهادة التجنس**

تتضمن شهادة التجنس صورتك، لكن العديد من المواطنين الجدد يلتقطون صوراً إضافية:
- حمل الشهادة مع العلم الأمريكي
- مع أفراد العائلة في المكان
- عند مدخل الحفل أو مع لافتات الحفل
- صور احترافية مجدولة بعد الحفل

**إنشاء تقاليد عائلية**

تحتفل بعض العائلات بذكرى المواطنة سنوياً:
- عشاء خاص في تاريخ الذكرى
- مشاركة القصة مع الأطفال كل عام
- الإضافة إلى دفتر ذكريات كل ذكرى
- عمل تطوعي مع منظمات تخدم المهاجرين

**التأمل في رحلتك**

خذ وقتاً لتقدير ما أنجزته. غالباً ما يتضمن الطريق من مهاجر إلى مواطن:
- مغادرة وطنك
- تعلم لغة جديدة
- بناء مهنة جديدة
- تربية أطفال بين ثقافتين
- التغلب على العقبات القانونية
- المثابرة خلال سنوات من الانتظار

لقد أظهرت المرونة والتصميم والالتزام. هذا الإنجاز لك ولكل من دعمك على طول الطريق.

**التطلع إلى الأمام**

بينما تحتفل، تتطلع أيضاً إلى المستقبل كمواطن أمريكي:
- فرص لم تكن متاحة لك سابقاً
- المشاركة الكاملة في الديمقراطية الأمريكية
- القدرة على رعاية أفراد العائلة للهجرة
- الأمان والاستقرار في وضعك
- الفرصة لرد الجميل للبلد الذي رحب بك

مواطنتك ليست نهاية بل بداية جديدة. المهارات والمنظور والخبرة التي تجلبها كمهاجر تقوي أمريكا وتثري المجتمعات التي تعيش فيها.`
