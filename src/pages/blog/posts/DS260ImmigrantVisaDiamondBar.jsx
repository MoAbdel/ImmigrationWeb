      locationIntro: "Diamond Bar, nestled in the eastern San Gabriel Valley, is home to a vibrant and growing Arab immigrant community. Many families in Diamond Bar are in the process of bringing loved ones from overseas through family-based immigrant visa petitions. Once your I-130 petition is approved and your case reaches the National Visa Center (NVC), the DS-260 Immigrant Visa Electronic Application becomes a critical step in your journey. SoCal Immigration Services provides comprehensive assistance to Diamond Bar families navigating this complex online application, ensuring every question is answered correctly and completely.",

          content: "Form DS-260, officially known as the Immigrant Visa Electronic Application, is an online form that must be completed by every applicant seeking an immigrant visa to the United States through consular processing. This form replaced the older paper-based DS-230 form and is now the standard application for all immigrant visa categories.\n\nThe DS-260 is a comprehensive questionnaire that collects detailed information about the visa applicant, including personal history, family background, employment, education, travel history, and security-related questions. Unlike many immigration forms, the DS-260 is completed entirely online through the Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC) portal.\n\nFor Diamond Bar families sponsoring relatives abroad, understanding the DS-260 is essential because:\n\n- It is required for all family-based immigrant visa applicants\n- Incorrect or incomplete information can cause significant delays\n- The form includes sensitive security questions that require careful attention\n- Answers provided on the DS-260 will be verified during the consular interview\n- The application can be unlocked and corrected if needed before the interview"

This marks the beginning of the NVC processing stage.\n\nDuring NVC processing, several things happen:\n\n- NVC creates your case and assigns a case number\n- You receive login credentials for the CEAC portal\n- You pay the required fees ($325 immigrant visa fee, $120 affidavit of support fee)\n- The beneficiary completes and submits the DS-260\n- The petitioner submits the Affidavit of Support (I-864)\n- Both parties submit required civil documents\n- NVC reviews all submissions for completeness\n\nFor Diamond Bar families, we recommend beginning DS-260 preparation as soon as you receive the NVC welcome letter. Having all information gathered in advance makes the online submission process much smoother."

Here is guidance on some of the most common issues Diamond Bar families encounter:\n\n**Name Questions:**\nEnter your name exactly as it appears on your passport. For Arabic names, use the transliteration in your passport. If your passport shows 'MOHAMMED' but your birth certificate shows 'MUHAMMAD', use the passport spelling and note the alternative in the 'other names' section.\n\n**Address History:**\nList every address where you have lived in the past 5 years, including temporary addresses. If you lived with family, include those addresses. For apartment numbers or building names, be as specific as possible.\n\n**Employment Gaps:**\nIf you were unemployed during any period, you must still account for that time. Options include 'unemployed', 'homemaker', 'student', or 'retired'. Never leave unexplained gaps.\n\n**Social Media:**\nSince 2019, the DS-260 requires disclosure of social media accounts used in the past 5 years. This includes Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other platforms. Provide usernames, not passwords.\n\n**Petitioner Questions:**\nYou will be asked about the person who filed the I-130 petition. Have the petitioner's full name, date of birth, address, and relationship ready."

Lying on the DS-260 can result in permanent visa denial and bars to future immigration benefits. If you have concerns about any question, consult with an immigration professional before submitting. Some past issues may be waivable, but dishonesty is never waivable."

Log into the CEAC portal with your case number\n2. Navigate to your submitted DS-260\n3. Click 'Request Unlock'\n4. Enter a brief explanation of why you need to make changes\n5. Wait for NVC to process the unlock request (usually 1-2 weeks)\n6. Once unlocked, make your corrections\n7. Re-submit the updated application\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- You can request an unlock at any time before your interview\n- Some consulates may ask you to unlock and update information before the interview\n- Keep records of what information you changed and why\n- After your interview is scheduled, contact the consulate directly for urgent changes"
