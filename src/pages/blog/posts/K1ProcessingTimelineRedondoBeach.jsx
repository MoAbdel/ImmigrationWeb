      locationIntro: "For couples in Redondo Beach and the South Bay area of Los Angeles, understanding the K-1 fiancé visa timeline is essential for planning your future together. Whether you met your fiancé while traveling abroad, through family connections, or online, the K-1 visa process has multiple stages with varying wait times. This guide provides current 2026 processing times and explains what happens at each stage so you can plan your wedding and life together.",
      summary: "The K-1 fiancé visa process currently takes 10-14 months from filing to visa issuance, though times vary by embassy. The process has four main stages: USCIS I-129F petition (6-9 months), National Visa Center transfer (1-2 months), embassy processing and interview (2-4 months), and entry/marriage (within 90 days of arrival). Understanding each stage helps couples plan effectively.",

          q: "Can I speed up the K-1 visa process?",
          a: "Unfortunately, there is no premium processing for the I-129F petition. USCIS and embassies process cases in order received. You can help prevent delays by submitting a complete petition with strong evidence upfront and responding quickly to any requests for additional information. Some couples file multiple times hoping for faster processing, but this is not recommended and can cause complications."
        },
        {
          q: "What if my fiancé's embassy has a very long wait time?",
          a: "Your fiancé's interview must occur at the embassy with jurisdiction over their residence. They cannot choose a different embassy with shorter wait times unless they genuinely relocate to that country. Some couples consider whether a CR-1 (marriage abroad first) visa might be faster for their specific situation, as CR-1 cases are processed differently."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my fiancé work while waiting for the K-1 visa?",
          a: "The K-1 visa itself does not authorize employment. Your fiancé cannot work upon arrival until they apply for and receive a work permit (EAD) through the I-485 adjustment of status process filed after marriage. EAD processing currently takes 3-6 months, so plan for this gap in income."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if we can't marry within 90 days?",
          a: "The 90-day rule is strict. If you don't marry within 90 days of your fiancé's entry, they lose status and must leave the U.S. There is no extension. The 90 days runs from the actual entry date stamped in the passport, not from the visa issuance date. Plan your wedding early in the 90-day period to have buffer for any issues."
        },
        {
          q: "Do we have to have a big wedding or is courthouse okay?",
          a: "Any legally valid marriage satisfies the K-1 requirement. A simple courthouse ceremony with the two of you and a witness is completely acceptable. Many couples do a small legal ceremony first to meet the 90-day deadline, then hold a larger celebration later. The immigration requirement is legal marriage, not any particular type of ceremony."
        },
        {
          q: "What if USCIS requests more evidence (RFE)?",
          a: "An RFE adds 2-4 months to processing. Respond thoroughly and quickly. Common RFE reasons include insufficient proof of meeting in person, unclear relationship evidence, or missing documents. Have an immigration professional review your response to ensure it fully addresses USCIS concerns. The goal is to avoid a second RFE or denial."
