          q: "What is the N-648 form and who needs it?",
          a: "Form N-648 is a Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions that can waive the English and civics test requirements for citizenship applicants with physical or developmental disabilities or mental impairments. You need this form if you have a medical condition that prevents you from learning or demonstrating knowledge of English and/or U.S. civics, even with accommodations."

        {
          q: "Can elderly applicants avoid the English test?",
          a: "Age alone does not exempt you from the English test. However, applicants who are 50+ with 20 years as a permanent resident, or 55+ with 15 years, can take the civics test in their native language. To avoid the English test entirely, you would need an N-648 medical waiver showing a condition that prevents learning English."
        },
        {
          q: "What conditions qualify for an N-648 waiver?",
          a: "Qualifying conditions include Alzheimer's disease, dementia, traumatic brain injury, intellectual disability, severe PTSD, schizophrenia, stroke with cognitive effects, severe depression affecting cognition, profound hearing or vision loss, and developmental disabilities. The key is that the condition must prevent you from learning, not just make it difficult."
        },
        {
          q: "Who can complete the N-648 form?",
          a: "The N-648 must be completed by a licensed medical doctor (MD), doctor of osteopathy (DO), clinical psychologist, or in some cases a licensed clinical social worker. The professional must be licensed to practice in the United States and must examine you within 6 months of when you file your N-400."
        },
        {
          q: "Will I still need to attend an interview with an N-648?",
          a: "Yes. The N-648 only waives the English and civics test requirements. You must still attend the naturalization interview, answer questions about your application (with an interpreter if needed), and take the Oath of Allegiance. The N-648 does not excuse you from all requirements."
        },
        {
          q: "Can USCIS deny my N-648 waiver?",
          a: "Yes. USCIS can deny an N-648 if it is incomplete, if the medical professional did not adequately explain how the condition prevents learning, if the examination is too old, or if they determine the condition does not qualify. If denied, you can provide additional evidence, get a new evaluation, or be required to take the tests."
        },
        {
          q: "What accommodations are available besides the N-648?",
          a: "USCIS offers many accommodations including sign language interpreters, large print materials, oral testing, extended testing time, breaks during the interview, wheelchair accessibility, quiet testing environments, and simplified instructions. You request these accommodations in writing when you file your N-400."

        {
          q: "How much does it cost to get an N-648 completed?",
          a: "Costs vary by provider. Some doctors charge $100-$500 to complete the N-648 evaluation and form. Community health centers may offer free or low-cost services. Medicare or Medicaid may cover the examination portion. Our office can provide referrals to affordable providers in the Arcadia area."
