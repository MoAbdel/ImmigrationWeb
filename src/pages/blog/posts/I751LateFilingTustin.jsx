This can result in:\n- Removal proceedings (deportation)\n- Loss of work authorization\n- Difficulties traveling internationally\n- Challenges with employment verification\n\nFor Tustin residents who have missed this deadline, immediate action is essential to preserve your immigration status and avoid serious consequences.",

          a: "Yes, you can file a late I-751 after your conditional green card has expired. You must include a detailed written explanation of why you missed the filing deadline, along with evidence supporting your reason. USCIS has discretion to accept late filings when there is good cause for the delay. Our Tustin office helps prepare compelling late filing packages."

          a: "Good cause includes serious medical conditions, hospitalization, death of a family member, domestic violence, natural disasters, military deployment, and attorney malpractice. USCIS evaluates each situation individually. Whatever your reason, you must document it thoroughly with evidence such as medical records, death certificates, or other proof."

          q: "Will I be deported if I file I-751 late?",

However, if USCIS denies your late filing, you may be placed in removal proceedings. This is why having a strong explanation and complete documentation is critical."
        },
        {
          q: "How late is too late to file I-751?",
          a: "There is no specific cutoff for filing a late I-751. USCIS has accepted filings months or even years late when the explanation was compelling. However, the longer you wait, the more difficult it becomes to explain the delay. File as soon as possible once you realize you missed the deadline."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I work with an expired conditional green card?",
          a: "Once your conditional green card expires and you have not filed I-751, your work authorization technically ends. However, if you file a late I-751 and receive a receipt notice, that receipt extends your status and work authorization for 24 months. This is why filing quickly is so important."

          q: "Do I need a lawyer to file a late I-751?",
          a: "While not legally required, professional assistance is strongly recommended for late I-751 filings. The explanation letter and supporting documentation must be carefully crafted to maximize your chances of success. Our Tustin office provides experienced document preparation assistance at affordable rates."
        },
        {
          q: "What if my spouse won't sign the late I-751?",
          a: "If your spouse refuses to sign or cannot be located, you may need to file a waiver request along with your late filing. Waiver categories include divorce, abuse, extreme hardship, or death of spouse. Each waiver has specific requirements and evidence needed."
