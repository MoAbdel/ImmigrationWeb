      locationIntro: "Facing immigration court proceedings is one of the most challenging experiences any immigrant can endure. For Arab immigrants living in Ontario and the surrounding Inland Empire communities, understanding the immigration court process is critical to protecting your rights and your family's future. The immigration court that handles cases for Ontario residents is part of the Los Angeles Immigration Court system, though hearings may be scheduled at various locations. SoCal Immigration Services provides comprehensive support to help individuals and families in Ontario navigate every stage of removal proceedings, from the initial master calendar hearing through appeals if necessary.",

          heading: "Understanding the Immigration Court System",
          content: "The U.S. immigration court system operates under the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is part of the Department of Justice. Immigration court is completely separate from the criminal court system. Immigration judges are administrative judges who decide whether individuals should be allowed to remain in the United States or be ordered removed (deported) to their home country.\n\nFor residents of Ontario and San Bernardino County, cases are typically handled by the Los Angeles Immigration Court, which is one of the busiest immigration courts in the entire nation. The court processes thousands of removal cases each year, resulting in significant backlogs and wait times that can extend several years.\n\nUnlike criminal court, immigration court proceedings are civil in nature. This means that while you have certain rights, you are NOT entitled to a government-appointed attorney if you cannot afford one. This makes it critically important to seek legal assistance early in your case and to prepare thoroughly for each hearing."

You will testify under oath, present evidence, and may have witnesses testify on your behalf. The government attorney will have the opportunity to cross-examine you and your witnesses.\n\nThe judge will evaluate your credibility (whether your testimony is believable), review all the evidence submitted, and apply the relevant legal standards to determine if you qualify for the relief you are seeking.

Remove metal items, belts, and electronics before entering the scanner.\n\n2. Finding Your Courtroom: Check the court docket or information board to find your courtroom number. Report to the correct courtroom and check in with the court clerk or assistant.\n\n3. Waiting Period: Immigration court schedules many cases at the same time. You may wait several hours before your case is called. Bring something quiet to do while waiting, but remain alert for your name.\n\n4. Courtroom Protocol: When entering the courtroom, silence your phone completely. Stand when the judge enters and exits. Address the judge as 'Your Honor.' Only speak when spoken to or when given permission.\n\n5. The Hearing Process: When your case is called, approach the respondent's table. Your attorney (if you have one) will speak on your behalf for most matters. Answer all questions truthfully and directly.\n\n6. Receiving the Decision: The judge may give an oral decision at the end of the hearing or may reserve the decision for a later written ruling. Listen carefully to any instructions about next steps."

Understanding how interpretation works helps ensure clear communication:\n\nCourt-Provided Interpreters: The immigration court provides interpreters for most languages, including Arabic. When you receive your hearing notice, it should indicate what language interpreter will be provided. If you need Arabic interpretation, make sure the court has this information.\n\nQuality of Interpretation: Court interpreters are generally qualified, but interpretation quality can vary. If you feel the interpreter is not accurately conveying your words, you have the right to speak up and ask for clarification.\n\nBringing Your Own Interpreter: You may also bring your own interpreter if you prefer. However, this interpreter must be approved by the court and may need to demonstrate language proficiency.\n\nDialect Considerations: Arabic has many dialects. If you speak a specific dialect (Iraqi, Levantine, Egyptian, Gulf, etc.), let the court know so they can try to provide an interpreter who understands your dialect.\n\nPreparing with Your Interpreter: If possible, meet with the interpreter before the hearing to ensure they understand any specialized vocabulary or terms relevant to your case.\n\nSpeaking Clearly: During testimony, speak clearly and in short sentences to allow accurate interpretation. Pause after each thought to give the interpreter time to translate."

Sunni or Shia Muslims may also face persecution depending on the country and their specific circumstances.\n\nPolitical Opinion: Journalists, activists, bloggers, and those who have spoken against their government may qualify for asylum. This includes those who participated in pro-democracy movements or criticized political or religious leaders.\n\nParticular Social Group: This can include women fleeing domestic violence or honor-based violence, LGBTQ individuals, individuals who worked with U.S. forces, or members of certain families or clans targeted for persecution.\n\nNationality and Ethnicity: Kurds, Palestinians, and other ethnic minorities may face persecution based on their ethnicity or nationality.\n\nTo win an asylum case, you must file within one year of arriving in the United States (with limited exceptions), demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, show the persecution is connected to a protected ground, and prove the government is unable or unwilling to protect you."

          content: "For long-term Ontario residents who do not have asylum claims, cancellation of removal may be an option. Non-LPR cancellation (often called the '10-year rule') has strict requirements:\n\n1. Continuous Physical Presence: You must prove you have been physically present in the United States for at least 10 years continuously. This presence is 'stopped' when you are served with a Notice to Appear (NTA).\n\n2. Good Moral Character: You must demonstrate good moral character throughout the 10-year period. Criminal convictions, fraud, and other negative factors can destroy good moral character.\n\n3. No Disqualifying Bars: Certain criminal convictions (aggravated felonies, drug trafficking, crimes of moral turpitude) and other factors permanently bar you from cancellation.\n\n4. Exceptional and Extremely Unusual Hardship: This is the most difficult requirement. You must prove that your removal would cause 'exceptional and extremely unusual hardship' to a qualifying relative who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. Normal hardship is not enough - you must show hardship significantly beyond what would normally be expected.\n\nQualifying relatives include U.S. citizen or LPR spouses, children, and parents. The hardship must be to them, not to yourself. Common hardship factors include serious medical conditions, special educational needs of children, country conditions that would affect the relative, and extreme economic hardship."

Understanding the appeals process is crucial:\n\nDeadline to Appeal: You must file your Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) within 30 days of the judge's decision. This deadline is strict - missing it means losing your right to appeal.\n\nBriefing Schedule: After filing the Notice of Appeal, you will have an opportunity to submit a written brief explaining why the judge's decision was wrong. The government may also submit a brief.\n\nStandard of Review: The BIA reviews the judge's legal conclusions de novo (fresh review) but generally defers to the judge's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\n\nPossible Outcomes: The BIA can affirm (uphold) the judge's decision, reverse the decision and grant you relief, or remand (send back) the case to the immigration judge for further proceedings.\n\nFederal Court Review: If the BIA denies your appeal, you may be able to seek further review in federal court (the Court of Appeals for the circuit where your case was heard). This requires filing a Petition for Review within 30 days of the BIA's decision.\n\nStay of Removal: Filing an appeal does not automatically stop your removal. You may need to file a separate motion for a stay of removal to prevent deportation while your appeal is pending."

You must attend every scheduled check-in unless you have received permission to reschedule.\n\nWhat to Bring: Bring identification, your check-in appointment letter, any documents ICE has requested, and contact information for your attorney. Some people choose to bring a small bag with essentials in case of detention.\n\nRisk of Detention: ICE can detain you at a check-in appointment. This risk increases if you have a criminal history, have received a final order of removal, or if enforcement priorities change. Discuss your risk level with an immigration attorney before each check-in.\n\nOrders of Supervision: Some individuals are placed on an 'Order of Supervision' which sets specific conditions they must follow. Violating these conditions can result in detention.\n\nAddress and Phone Updates: You must keep ICE informed of your current address and phone number. Failure to do so can be used against you in your immigration case and can result in being taken into custody.\n\nThe ICE field office serving Ontario and San Bernardino County is located in the region. Check your documentation for the specific address where you are required to report."

You can use this number to check your next hearing date and the status of your case.\n\nLegal Aid Organizations: Several organizations provide free or low-cost immigration legal services to individuals in removal proceedings in the Inland Empire region. Contact local legal aid offices, law school immigration clinics, and nonprofit immigration organizations.\n\nKnow Your Rights Presentations: Many community organizations offer Know Your Rights presentations that explain your rights during immigration court proceedings and encounters with immigration officials.\n\nICE Reporting Location: Individuals under supervision orders or with check-in requirements should verify their specific reporting location. The regional ICE ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) office handles check-ins for the area.\n\nCommunity Support: Ontario's Arab community has resources including mosques, community centers, and cultural organizations that may be able to connect you with support services and legal referrals.\n\nEmergency Legal Help: If you are detained or a family member is detained, contact an immigration attorney or legal aid organization immediately.

Review your application and any prior statements to ensure your testimony matches. Focus on the most important details that support your case.\n\nAnticipate Questions: Think about difficult questions the judge or government attorney might ask. Practice answering these questions honestly and directly without becoming defensive or argumentative.\n\nPrepare Witnesses: If you have witnesses who will testify, make sure they know what to expect and have reviewed their written declarations. Witnesses should be prepared for cross-examination.\n\nPlan Logistics: Know exactly where the court is located and how to get there. Plan to arrive early. Arrange childcare if needed - children generally should not attend court unless they are testifying.\n\nDress Appropriately: Wear clean, conservative, professional clothing. This shows respect for the court and presents you in the best light.\n\nBring Support: Family members can attend your hearing for moral support. They may need to wait outside during testimony, but their presence can help calm your nerves.\n\nStay Calm: Immigration court is stressful, but try to remain calm and composed. Take deep breaths. Answer questions thoughtfully. If you need a moment to compose yourself, you can ask.\n\nFollow Instructions: Listen carefully to the judge's instructions. Do exactly what the judge tells you to do.

This removal order goes on your permanent record and can make you ineligible for many forms of immigration relief in the future. If you miss a hearing, you may be able to file a Motion to Reopen if you can show 'exceptional circumstances' such as serious illness, mail delivery failure, or ineffective assistance of counsel. Act quickly - there are strict deadlines."

          q: "How long will my immigration court case take?",
          a: "Immigration court cases involving the Los Angeles court typically take 2-5 years or longer from start to finish. Master calendar hearings are often scheduled 6-12 months after the Notice to Appear is filed, and individual merits hearings may be scheduled years after that due to significant court backlogs. During this time, you must maintain your address on file with the court and attend all scheduled hearings."

If you have filed an asylum application, you can apply for work authorization (Employment Authorization Document or EAD) 180 days after filing your asylum application (or when the 180-day clock has expired). Other forms of relief may also make you eligible for work authorization. Your eligibility depends on your specific situation and the forms of relief you are seeking."

You have the right to speak with an attorney. Do not sign any documents without reading them carefully and consulting with an attorney if possible. Do not sign anything that is not true. Contact family members and an immigration attorney as soon as possible."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my case be dismissed or terminated?",
          a: "In some circumstances, yes. Prosecutorial discretion allows ICE to agree to dismiss or terminate proceedings in certain cases, though this has become less common in recent years. Administrative closure temporarily removes cases from the court's active docket but does not end the case permanently. A judge may also terminate proceedings if there are legal defects in the charging document or if you become eligible for legal status through another avenue."

          q: "What is the difference between removal and deportation?",
          a: "Technically, 'removal' is the current legal term for what was formerly called 'deportation.' Since 1996, the immigration laws use 'removal' to describe the process of being ordered to leave the United States. However, many people still use 'deportation' colloquially. Both terms refer to being ordered to leave the country, often with bars to returning for a period of years (typically 5, 10, or 20 years, or permanently depending on circumstances)."

      locationIntro: "تعد مواجهة إجراءات محكمة الهجرة واحدة من أكثر التجارب صعوبة التي يمكن أن يمر بها أي مهاجر. بالنسبة للمهاجرين العرب الذين يعيشون في أونتاريو ومجتمعات إنلاند إمباير المحيطة، فإن فهم عملية محكمة الهجرة أمر بالغ الأهمية لحماية حقوقك ومستقبل عائلتك. محكمة الهجرة التي تتعامل مع قضايا سكان أونتاريو هي جزء من نظام محكمة الهجرة في لوس أنجلوس، رغم أن الجلسات قد تُجدول في مواقع مختلفة. تقدم خدمات حلول الهجرة دعماً شاملاً لمساعدة الأفراد والعائلات في أونتاريو على التنقل في كل مرحلة من إجراءات الترحيل، من جلسة التقويم الرئيسي الأولى وحتى الاستئنافات إذا لزم الأمر.",

          a: "تفويت جلسة المحكمة أمر خطير للغاية. من المرجح أن يأمر القاضي بترحيلك 'غيابياً' (في غيابك). يُسجل أمر الترحيل هذا في سجلك الدائم ويمكن أن يجعلك غير مؤهل للعديد من أشكال الإعفاء في الهجرة مستقبلاً. إذا فاتتك جلسة، قد تتمكن من تقديم طلب إعادة فتح إذا أمكنك إظهار 'ظروف استثنائية' مثل مرض خطير أو فشل في توصيل البريد أو مساعدة غير فعالة من المحامي. تصرف بسرعة - هناك مواعيد نهائية صارمة."

        {
          q: "كم ستستغرق قضية محكمة الهجرة الخاصة بي؟",
          a: "قضايا محكمة الهجرة التي تشمل محكمة لوس أنجلوس تستغرق عادةً 2-5 سنوات أو أكثر من البداية إلى النهاية. تُجدول جلسات التقويم الرئيسي غالباً بعد 6-12 شهراً من تقديم إشعار المثول، وقد تُجدول جلسات الاستحقاقات الفردية بعد سنوات من ذلك بسبب التراكمات الكبيرة في المحكمة. خلال هذا الوقت، يجب الحفاظ على عنوانك مسجلاً لدى المحكمة وحضور جميع الجلسات المجدولة."

        {
          q: "هل يمكنني العمل أثناء انتظار قضية الترحيل؟",
          a: "في كثير من الحالات، نعم. إذا قدمت طلب لجوء، يمكنك التقدم لإذن العمل (وثيقة إذن العمل أو EAD) بعد 180 يوماً من تقديم طلب اللجوء (أو عندما تنتهي ساعة 180 يوماً). أشكال أخرى من الإعفاء قد تجعلك أيضاً مؤهلاً لإذن العمل. أهليتك تعتمد على وضعك المحدد وأشكال الإعفاء التي تسعى إليها."

          q: "ماذا يجب أن أفعل إذا اعتقلتني ICE؟",
          a: "ابق هادئاً ومارس حقوقك. لديك الحق في البقاء صامتاً ولا يجب الإجابة على أسئلة حول وضعك في الهجرة أو بلد ميلادك. لديك الحق في التحدث مع محامٍ. لا توقع أي وثائق دون قراءتها بعناية والتشاور مع محامٍ إن أمكن. لا توقع على أي شيء غير صحيح. اتصل بأفراد العائلة ومحامي هجرة في أقرب وقت ممكن."
        },
        {
          q: "هل يمكن رفض قضيتي أو إنهاؤها؟",
          a: "في بعض الظروف، نعم. السلطة التقديرية للنيابة تسمح لـ ICE بالموافقة على رفض أو إنهاء الإجراءات في قضايا معينة، رغم أن هذا أصبح أقل شيوعاً في السنوات الأخيرة. الإغلاق الإداري يزيل القضايا مؤقتاً من جدول المحكمة النشط لكنه لا ينهي القضية بشكل دائم. قد ينهي القاضي أيضاً الإجراءات إذا كانت هناك عيوب قانونية في وثيقة الاتهام أو إذا أصبحت مؤهلاً للوضع القانوني من خلال طريق آخر."

        {
          q: "ما الفرق بين الإبعاد والترحيل؟",
          a: "تقنياً، 'الإبعاد' هو المصطلح القانوني الحالي لما كان يسمى سابقاً 'الترحيل'. منذ عام 1996، تستخدم قوانين الهجرة 'الإبعاد' لوصف عملية الأمر بمغادرة الولايات المتحدة. ومع ذلك، لا يزال كثير من الناس يستخدمون 'الترحيل' بشكل عامي. كلا المصطلحين يشيران إلى الأمر بمغادرة البلاد، غالباً مع حظر العودة لفترة من السنوات (عادةً 5 أو 10 أو 20 سنة، أو بشكل دائم حسب الظروف)."
