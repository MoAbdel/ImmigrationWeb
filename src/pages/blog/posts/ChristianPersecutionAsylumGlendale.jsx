      locationIntro: "Glendale, home to one of the largest Armenian populations outside Armenia and a significant Middle Eastern Christian community, understands the reality of religious persecution. Chaldean Christians from Iraq, Coptic Christians from Egypt, Assyrian Christians, and Christians from Syria, Lebanon, and other Middle Eastern countries have found refuge here. If you face persecution because of your Christian faith, asylum law provides a path to protection in the United States.",
      summary: "Religious persecution is a recognized ground for asylum. Christians from Middle Eastern countries can qualify for asylum by demonstrating they face persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution based on their religion. Documentation of persecution, country conditions evidence, and personal testimony all support these claims. Early filing (within one year of arrival) is crucial for eligibility.",

If circumstances in your country have changed (increased persecution of Christians) or you faced extraordinary circumstances (serious illness, mental health issues from trauma, bad legal advice), exceptions may apply. You can also seek withholding of removal and CAT protection, which have no one-year deadline but offer less protection. Consult an immigration attorney immediately."

          a: "Religious tattoos can be valuable evidence of your faith and can demonstrate that returning would be dangerous if the tattoo is visible and would identify you as Christian. Many Coptic Christians have cross tattoos, and these can support both your religious identity and the danger of return. Document these with photographs for your application."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I apply for asylum if I converted to Christianity after leaving my country?",
          a: "Yes, but these cases face additional scrutiny. USCIS will assess whether your conversion is genuine and whether you would face persecution if returned. Evidence of sincere conversion includes church membership, baptism, regular attendance, knowledge of Christianity, lifestyle changes, and testimony from religious leaders. Converting shortly before filing raises credibility concerns."
        },
        {
          q: "My family in Iraq/Egypt is still alive. Does that hurt my case?",
          a: "Not necessarily. You must show why YOU face persecution, which may differ from your family's situation. Perhaps you were more visible, more active in church, or specifically targeted. Your family remaining doesn't mean persecution isn't real - many families remain because they cannot leave, face different levels of threat, or hide their faith. Explain your individual circumstances."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if I return to my home country while my asylum case is pending?",
          a: "Returning to the country where you claim persecution generally destroys your asylum case. It suggests you don't actually fear return. If you return after asylum is granted, USCIS can consider this evidence that conditions have changed and potentially terminate your asylum. Do not travel to your home country during the asylum process or after."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I work while my asylum application is pending?",
          a: "Not immediately. You can apply for work authorization (Form I-765) 150 days after filing your asylum application if no decision has been made. USCIS then has 30 days to adjudicate. The 180-day 'asylum clock' can be stopped by certain actions, extending the wait. Many asylum seekers wait 6-12 months before receiving work authorization."
