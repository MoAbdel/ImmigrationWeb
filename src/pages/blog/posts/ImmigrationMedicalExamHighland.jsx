        <p class="lead">The immigration medical examination, documented on Form I-693, is one of the most critical yet often misunderstood requirements in the green card application process. For Arab families in Highland, California, and throughout the Inland Empire, understanding this examination thoroughly can prevent costly delays and ensure a smooth path to permanent residency. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about the I-693 medical exam, from finding qualified civil surgeons to understanding what happens if medical issues are discovered.</p>

        <h2>What is Form I-693 and Why is it Required?</h2>
        <p>Form I-693, officially titled "Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record," serves as the official documentation of your immigration medical examination. The United States immigration system requires this examination to ensure that immigrants do not pose a public health risk and meet the health-related grounds of admissibility established by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p>

        <p>The medical examination requirement exists for several important purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Public Health Protection:</strong> The examination screens for communicable diseases that could pose a threat to public health in the United States</li>
          <li><strong>Vaccination Compliance:</strong> It ensures that immigrants have received all required vaccinations, contributing to community immunity</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation of Health Status:</strong> It creates a baseline health record for individuals entering the permanent resident population</li>
          <li><strong>Identification of Conditions:</strong> It identifies physical or mental disorders that could affect admissibility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The I-693 form itself is completed by the designated civil surgeon who performs your examination. You do not fill out this form yourself – your role is to provide the necessary documentation and undergo the required tests and evaluations.</p>

        <h2>Who Needs an Immigration Medical Examination?</h2>
        <p>Understanding whether you need a medical examination depends on your specific immigration pathway. The following categories of applicants are required to complete Form I-693:</p>

        <h3>Applicants Who Must Complete I-693</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adjustment of Status Applicants (I-485):</strong> Anyone applying for a green card while already in the United States must complete the medical examination</li>
          <li><strong>Diversity Visa Lottery Winners:</strong> Individuals selected in the diversity visa program processing within the United States</li>
          <li><strong>Certain Employment-Based Green Card Applicants:</strong> Workers adjusting status through employer sponsorship</li>
          <li><strong>Family-Based Immigration:</strong> Spouses, parents, children, and siblings of U.S. citizens or permanent residents</li>
          <li><strong>Special Immigrant Categories:</strong> Including religious workers, certain juveniles, and other special categories</li>
          <li><strong>Refugees Applying for Adjustment:</strong> Refugees adjusting to permanent resident status one year after admission</li>
          <li><strong>Asylees Applying for Adjustment:</strong> Individuals granted asylum seeking permanent residence</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applicants Who May Be Exempt</h3>
        <p>Some applicants may have different medical examination requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>K Visa Holders:</strong> Fiancé(e) visa holders who completed a medical examination abroad within the validity period</li>
          <li><strong>Certain Parolees:</strong> Individuals who underwent medical examination before parole may have limited additional requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Applicants with Valid Prior Examinations:</strong> If you have a previously completed I-693 that is still within the validity period</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Finding a Designated Civil Surgeon in Highland</h2>
        <p>Not just any doctor can perform the immigration medical examination. You must see a physician who has been specifically designated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as a "civil surgeon." These physicians have received special training and authorization to conduct immigration medical examinations.</p>

        <h3>How to Find a Civil Surgeon</h3>
        <p>USCIS maintains an official database of designated civil surgeons that you can search by location. For Highland residents, there are several options in the immediate area and throughout the Inland Empire. To find a civil surgeon:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Visit the USCIS website and use the "Find a Doctor" tool</li>
          <li>Enter your zip code or city (Highland, CA 92346)</li>
          <li>Review the list of designated civil surgeons in your area</li>
          <li>Call to verify availability, costs, and appointment scheduling</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Questions to Ask When Choosing a Civil Surgeon</h3>
        <p>When selecting a civil surgeon, consider asking these important questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the total cost for the examination, including all required tests?</li>
          <li>Do you administer vaccinations on-site, or will I need to obtain them elsewhere?</li>
          <li>How long does the entire examination process take?</li>
          <li>Do you have staff members who speak Arabic?</li>
          <li>What forms of payment do you accept?</li>
          <li>How quickly can I get an appointment?</li>
          <li>What documentation do I need to bring?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Bring to Your Medical Examination</h2>
        <p>Proper preparation for your medical examination appointment can save time and prevent the need for additional visits. Here is a comprehensive list of documents and items you should bring:</p>

        <h3>Required Documentation</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Document</th>
              <th>Purpose</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Government-issued photo ID</td>
              <td>Identity verification</td>
              <td>Passport, state ID, or driver's license</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Passport (if available)</td>
              <td>Primary identification</td>
              <td>Current or expired passport</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Form I-693 (blank copy)</td>
              <td>Medical examination form</td>
              <td>Download the latest version from USCIS website</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Vaccination records</td>
              <td>Proof of prior vaccinations</td>
              <td>Original records preferred; translations needed for Arabic documents</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Previous medical records</td>
              <td>Document existing conditions</td>
              <td>Especially important for chronic conditions</td>

              <td>If already filed</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Vaccination Records from Your Home Country</h3>
        <p>Many Arab immigrants have vaccination records from their home countries. These records are valuable and can reduce the number of vaccinations you need during the examination. However, records in Arabic or other languages must be accompanied by certified English translations. Your civil surgeon may accept records in their original language if they can read them, but having translations prepared is advisable.</p>

        <h2>The Physical Examination Process</h2>
        <p>The physical examination portion of the I-693 is comprehensive and includes multiple components. Understanding what to expect can help reduce anxiety and ensure you are properly prepared.</p>

        <h3>Components of the Physical Examination</h3>
        <p>The civil surgeon will conduct the following evaluations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>General Physical Assessment:</strong> Height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature measurements</li>
          <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Visual acuity testing and examination for diseases</li>
          <li><strong>Ears, Nose, and Throat:</strong> Basic examination of these systems</li>
          <li><strong>Heart and Lungs:</strong> Listening to heart and lung sounds with a stethoscope</li>
          <li><strong>Abdomen:</strong> Palpation to check for abnormalities</li>
          <li><strong>Lymph Nodes:</strong> Examination for swelling that might indicate disease</li>
          <li><strong>Skin:</strong> Visual examination for signs of disease or conditions</li>
          <li><strong>Extremities:</strong> Basic assessment of arms and legs</li>
          <li><strong>Neurological:</strong> Basic assessment of reflexes and coordination</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What the Doctor is Looking For</h3>
        <p>The civil surgeon is specifically assessing for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Communicable diseases of public health significance</li>
          <li>Physical disorders that could pose a threat to safety</li>
          <li>Drug abuse or addiction</li>
          <li>General health status documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Required Vaccinations for Immigration</h2>
        <p>The vaccination requirements for immigration are extensive and based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). These requirements apply to all adjustment of status applicants regardless of age, though age-appropriate considerations are applied.</p>

        <h3>Vaccination Waivers</h3>
        <p>In limited circumstances, vaccination waivers may be available:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medical Contraindication:</strong> If a vaccine would be harmful to your health, a waiver may be granted with documentation from your physician</li>
          <li><strong>Religious or Moral Objection:</strong> Waivers may be available for sincere religious or moral objections, though approval is not guaranteed</li>
          <li><strong>Not Age-Appropriate:</strong> Vaccines not recommended for your age group are not required</li>
          <li><strong>Not Medically Appropriate:</strong> Certain vaccines may not be required if not medically appropriate for your situation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tuberculosis (TB) Testing Requirements</h2>
        <p>Tuberculosis screening is one of the most important components of the immigration medical examination. The United States takes TB prevention seriously due to its communicable nature and public health implications.</p>

        <h3>Types of TB Tests</h3>
        <p>Civil surgeons may use one of two approved testing methods:</p>

        <h4>Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) - Mantoux Test</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A small amount of testing material is injected under the skin of your forearm</li>
          <li>You must return 48-72 hours later for the result reading</li>
          <li>The doctor measures any reaction at the injection site</li>
          <li>This test requires two visits to complete</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) - Blood Test</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A blood sample is drawn and sent to a laboratory</li>
          <li>Results are typically available within a few days</li>
          <li>Only one visit is required for the test itself</li>
          <li>Generally more expensive than the skin test</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Happens if TB Test is Positive?</h3>
        <p>A positive TB test does not automatically mean you have active tuberculosis. Many people have latent TB infection, meaning the bacteria are present but inactive. If your TB test is positive:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Chest X-Ray Required:</strong> You will need a chest X-ray to check for signs of active TB disease</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluation of Symptoms:</strong> The civil surgeon will ask about symptoms like cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats</li>
          <li><strong>Possible Sputum Testing:</strong> If the X-ray shows abnormalities or you have symptoms, additional testing may be required</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment May Be Required:</strong> If active TB is found, treatment must be completed before immigration approval</li>
          <li><strong>Latent TB:</strong> If you have latent TB (positive test but negative X-ray and no symptoms), you can still proceed with immigration but may need to complete treatment</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Special Considerations for BCG Vaccination</h3>
        <p>Many Arab immigrants received the BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccination in their home countries. This vaccine, common in Middle Eastern countries, can cause false-positive reactions on the tuberculin skin test. If you received BCG vaccination:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The IGRA blood test may be preferred as it is not affected by BCG vaccination</li>
          <li>Inform your civil surgeon about your BCG vaccination history</li>
          <li>Bring any documentation of your BCG vaccination if available</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mental Health and Behavioral Evaluation</h2>
        <p>The immigration medical examination includes an assessment of mental health and behavior. This evaluation is designed to identify conditions that could affect admissibility under the health-related grounds.</p>

        <h3>What the Evaluation Includes</h3>
        <p>The mental health evaluation typically involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Questions about your mental health history</li>
          <li>Inquiry about any psychiatric diagnoses or treatments</li>
          <li>Assessment of current mental status</li>
          <li>Questions about substance use and history</li>
          <li>Evaluation of any behavioral concerns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conditions That May Require Additional Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Certain conditions may require additional documentation or evaluation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>History of mental health treatment:</strong> Previous psychiatric hospitalizations or ongoing treatment</li>
          <li><strong>Substance use disorders:</strong> History of drug or alcohol abuse</li>
          <li><strong>Behavioral concerns:</strong> History of violence or harmful behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Having a mental health condition does not automatically make you inadmissible. The evaluation focuses on whether any condition poses a threat to yourself or others or could result in harmful behavior.</p>

        <h2>I-693 Validity Period and Timing Considerations</h2>
        <p>Understanding the validity period of Form I-693 is crucial for proper timing of your medical examination. The rules regarding validity are specific and must be followed carefully to avoid the need for a repeat examination.</p>

        <h3>Current Validity Rules</h3>
        <p>As of the current USCIS guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Two-Year Validity:</strong> Form I-693 is valid for two years from the date the civil surgeon signs it</li>
          <li><strong>Timing Relative to I-485:</strong> The civil surgeon's signature date must be no more than 60 days before you file Form I-485</li>
          <li><strong>Must Be Valid at Adjudication:</strong> The I-693 must still be valid when USCIS makes a decision on your green card application</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strategic Timing Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Given the validity period, consider these timing strategies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wait Until I-485 is Pending:</strong> Some applicants choose to wait until their I-485 is filed before completing the medical examination, though this can delay processing</li>
          <li><strong>Submit with I-485:</strong> Submitting the I-693 with your initial I-485 application can streamline processing</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor Processing Times:</strong> Consider current USCIS processing times when deciding when to complete your examination</li>
          <li><strong>Plan for Possible Delays:</strong> If you expect your case to take longer than two years, discuss timing with your attorney</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h4>Important Timing Note</h4>
          <p>If your I-693 expires before USCIS adjudicates your case, you will receive a Request for Evidence (RFE) asking for a new medical examination. This means additional costs and time. Proper timing planning can help avoid this situation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Sealed Envelope: Understanding Proper Handling</h2>
        <p>After completing your medical examination, the civil surgeon will provide you with your completed Form I-693 in a sealed envelope. Proper handling of this envelope is extremely important.</p>

        <h3>Rules for Handling the Sealed Envelope</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do Not Open the Envelope:</strong> Under no circumstances should you open the sealed envelope. An opened envelope will not be accepted by USCIS</li>
          <li><strong>Keep it Safe:</strong> Store the envelope in a secure location where it will not be damaged</li>
          <li><strong>Submit Unopened:</strong> When submitting your I-485 or responding to an RFE, include the unopened, sealed envelope</li>
          <li><strong>Request a Copy:</strong> Ask your civil surgeon for an unsealed copy for your personal records before the sealed envelope is prepared</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What if the Envelope is Opened or Damaged?</h3>
        <p>If your sealed envelope is accidentally opened or damaged:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact the civil surgeon immediately</li>

        <h2>Medical Conditions That May Affect Green Card Approval</h2>
        <p>Certain medical conditions can affect your admissibility to the United States. Understanding these conditions and how they are evaluated can help you prepare for potential issues.</p>

        <h3>Class A Conditions (Inadmissible)</h3>
        <p>Class A conditions are those that make an applicant inadmissible to the United States without a waiver:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Communicable Diseases of Public Health Significance:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Active tuberculosis</li>

              <li>Gonorrhea</li>
              <li>Leprosy (infectious)</li>
              <li>Other diseases as determined by the CDC</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Failure to Show Required Vaccinations:</strong> Not having required vaccinations without an approved waiver</li>

          <li><strong>Drug Abuse or Addiction:</strong> Current drug abuse or addiction as determined by the civil surgeon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Class B Conditions (Not Inadmissible but Documented)</h3>
        <p>Class B conditions are significant health conditions that are documented but do not make you inadmissible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical or mental conditions that may require treatment but do not pose a threat</li>
          <li>Chronic diseases under control</li>
          <li>Physical disabilities</li>
          <li>Mental health conditions managed with treatment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Waivers for Medical Grounds of Inadmissibility</h3>
        <p>If you have a Class A condition, waivers may be available in certain circumstances. Waiver availability depends on the specific condition and your individual circumstances. Our immigration attorneys can help evaluate whether a waiver may be available in your case.</p>

        <h2>Costs and Fees for Immigration Medical Examination</h2>
        <p>The cost of the immigration medical examination can vary significantly depending on the civil surgeon, location, and what services are needed. Understanding the potential costs can help you budget appropriately.</p>

        <h2>The Appeal Process for Medical Inadmissibility</h2>

        <h3>Steps to Address Medical Inadmissibility</h3>

          <li><strong>Understand the Specific Finding:</strong> Review exactly what condition or issue led to the inadmissibility determination</li>
          <li><strong>Seek a Second Opinion:</strong> You may request an examination by another designated civil surgeon</li>
          <li><strong>Obtain Additional Documentation:</strong> Gather medical records, specialist evaluations, and treatment documentation</li>
          <li><strong>Apply for a Waiver:</strong> Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, may be appropriate for certain conditions</li>
          <li><strong>Complete Required Treatment:</strong> For conditions like active TB, completing treatment can resolve the inadmissibility</li>
          <li><strong>Appeal the Decision:</strong> If your green card is denied, you may have appeal rights depending on your circumstances</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does the immigration medical examination take?</h3>
          <p>The initial examination appointment typically takes 30-60 minutes. However, if you need the TB skin test, you will need to return 48-72 hours later for the result reading. If vaccinations are needed, additional time is required. The entire process from first appointment to receiving your sealed envelope typically takes 1-2 weeks, though this can vary based on test results and vaccination schedules.</p>

          <h3>Can I use my regular doctor for the immigration medical examination?</h3>
          <p>No, only USCIS-designated civil surgeons can perform the immigration medical examination and complete Form I-693. Your regular doctor cannot complete this form even if they are willing to do so. However, you can ask your regular doctor for copies of your medical records and vaccination history to bring to the civil surgeon, which may save time and reduce costs.</p>

          <h3>What happens if I am pregnant during my medical examination?</h3>
          <p>Pregnancy does not prevent you from completing the immigration medical examination. However, some vaccinations and tests may be modified or delayed due to pregnancy. The civil surgeon will make appropriate accommodations and document any vaccines that are deferred due to pregnancy. You may be asked to complete those vaccinations after delivery.</p>

          <h3>Do my children need separate medical examinations?</h3>
          <p>Yes, every person applying for a green card, regardless of age, must have their own medical examination. Children and infants are subject to age-appropriate requirements, meaning they will not receive vaccinations or tests that are not recommended for their age group. Each family member will need their own Form I-693 completed by a civil surgeon.</p>

          <h3>How long is Form I-693 valid?</h3>
          <p>Form I-693 is valid for two years from the date the civil surgeon signs the form. The civil surgeon's signature must be dated no more than 60 days before you file your I-485 application. If your I-693 expires before USCIS decides your case, you will need to obtain a new medical examination, which means additional costs and delays.</p>

          <h3>What if I have a medical condition that requires ongoing treatment?</h3>
          <p>Having a chronic medical condition that requires ongoing treatment does not automatically make you inadmissible. Many conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and mental health conditions managed with medication, are classified as Class B conditions, which are documented but do not prevent green card approval. The key factor is whether the condition poses a threat to safety or public health.</p>

          <h3>Can I refuse certain vaccinations on religious grounds?</h3>
          <p>You may request a waiver for vaccinations based on religious or moral convictions. However, approval is not guaranteed and is at USCIS discretion. You must demonstrate sincere religious or moral beliefs that oppose vaccinations. Blanket waivers for all vaccines are rarely granted, and waivers for certain vaccines (like those preventing highly communicable diseases) may be more difficult to obtain.</p>

          <h3>What documents should I bring if my vaccination records are in Arabic?</h3>
          <p>If your vaccination records are in Arabic, you should bring both the original documents and certified English translations. While some civil surgeons may be able to read Arabic records, having translations prepared ensures there are no misunderstandings and speeds up the process. Translation services are available through certified translators, and our office can provide referrals if needed.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Preparing for Your Green Card Interview After the Medical Examination</h2>
        <p>Once your medical examination is complete and your Form I-693 is ready, you are one step closer to your green card interview. The medical examination results become part of your immigration file and may be reviewed during your interview.</p>

        <h3>What to Expect at the Interview Regarding Medical Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The officer may ask if there have been any changes to your health since the examination</li>
          <li>If there were any Class B findings, you may be asked about the condition</li>
          <li>Bring any additional medical documentation related to ongoing conditions</li>
          <li>Be prepared to discuss any vaccinations that were deferred</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead">الفحص الطبي للهجرة، الموثق في نموذج I-693، هو أحد أهم المتطلبات وأكثرها سوء فهماً في عملية طلب البطاقة الخضراء. للعائلات العربية في هايلاند، كاليفورنيا، وفي جميع أنحاء إمباير إنلاند، فإن فهم هذا الفحص بشكل شامل يمكن أن يمنع التأخيرات المكلفة ويضمن مساراً سلساً نحو الإقامة الدائمة. يغطي هذا الدليل الشامل كل ما تحتاج معرفته عن الفحص الطبي I-693، من إيجاد الجراحين المدنيين المؤهلين إلى فهم ما يحدث إذا تم اكتشاف مشاكل طبية.</p>

        <h2>ما هو نموذج I-693 ولماذا هو مطلوب؟</h2>
        <p>نموذج I-693، المعنون رسمياً "تقرير الفحص الطبي وسجل التطعيمات"، يعمل كالتوثيق الرسمي لفحصك الطبي للهجرة. يتطلب نظام الهجرة الأمريكي هذا الفحص للتأكد من أن المهاجرين لا يشكلون خطراً على الصحة العامة ويستوفون الأسس الصحية للقبول المنصوص عليها في قانون الهجرة والجنسية (INA).</p>

        <p>يوجد متطلب الفحص الطبي لعدة أغراض مهمة:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>حماية الصحة العامة:</strong> يفحص الفحص الأمراض المعدية التي قد تشكل تهديداً للصحة العامة في الولايات المتحدة</li>
          <li><strong>الامتثال للتطعيمات:</strong> يضمن حصول المهاجرين على جميع التطعيمات المطلوبة، مما يساهم في مناعة المجتمع</li>
          <li><strong>توثيق الحالة الصحية:</strong> يُنشئ سجلاً صحياً أساسياً للأفراد الداخلين إلى سكان المقيمين الدائمين</li>
          <li><strong>تحديد الحالات:</strong> يحدد الاضطرابات الجسدية أو النفسية التي قد تؤثر على القبول</li>
        </ul>

        <p>نموذج I-693 نفسه يُكمله الجراح المدني المعين الذي يجري فحصك. أنت لا تملأ هذا النموذج بنفسك – دورك هو تقديم الوثائق اللازمة والخضوع للاختبارات والتقييمات المطلوبة.</p>

        <h2>من يحتاج إلى فحص طبي للهجرة؟</h2>
        <p>يعتمد فهم ما إذا كنت بحاجة إلى فحص طبي على مسار الهجرة الخاص بك. الفئات التالية من المتقدمين مطالبة بإكمال نموذج I-693:</p>

        <h3>المتقدمون الذين يجب عليهم إكمال I-693</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>متقدمو تعديل الوضع (I-485):</strong> أي شخص يتقدم للحصول على بطاقة خضراء وهو موجود بالفعل في الولايات المتحدة يجب عليه إكمال الفحص الطبي</li>
          <li><strong>الفائزون بقرعة التأشيرات المتنوعة:</strong> الأفراد المختارون في برنامج تأشيرات التنوع الذين يعالجون داخل الولايات المتحدة</li>
          <li><strong>بعض متقدمي البطاقة الخضراء القائمة على التوظيف:</strong> العمال الذين يعدلون وضعهم من خلال رعاية صاحب العمل</li>
          <li><strong>الهجرة العائلية:</strong> الأزواج والآباء والأطفال والأشقاء للمواطنين الأمريكيين أو المقيمين الدائمين</li>
          <li><strong>فئات المهاجرين الخاصة:</strong> بما في ذلك العمال الدينيون وبعض الأحداث والفئات الخاصة الأخرى</li>
          <li><strong>اللاجئون المتقدمون للتعديل:</strong> اللاجئون الذين يعدلون إلى وضع المقيم الدائم بعد سنة من القبول</li>
          <li><strong>طالبو اللجوء المتقدمون للتعديل:</strong> الأفراد الممنوحون اللجوء الذين يسعون للإقامة الدائمة</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>المتقدمون الذين قد يكونون معفيين</h3>
        <p>قد يكون لبعض المتقدمين متطلبات فحص طبي مختلفة:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>حاملو تأشيرة K:</strong> حاملو تأشيرة الخطيب/الخطيبة الذين أكملوا فحصاً طبياً في الخارج خلال فترة الصلاحية</li>
          <li><strong>بعض المفرج عنهم بشروط:</strong> الأفراد الذين خضعوا لفحص طبي قبل الإفراج المشروط قد يكون لديهم متطلبات إضافية محدودة</li>
          <li><strong>المتقدمون بفحوصات سابقة صالحة:</strong> إذا كان لديك I-693 مكتمل سابقاً لا يزال ضمن فترة الصلاحية</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>إيجاد جراح مدني معين في هايلاند</h2>
        <p>ليس كل طبيب يمكنه إجراء الفحص الطبي للهجرة. يجب أن ترى طبيباً تم تعيينه خصيصاً من قبل خدمات المواطنة والهجرة الأمريكية (USCIS) كـ "جراح مدني". هؤلاء الأطباء تلقوا تدريباً خاصاً وإذناً لإجراء الفحوصات الطبية للهجرة.</p>

        <h3>سجلات التطعيم من بلدك الأصلي</h3>
        <p>العديد من المهاجرين العرب لديهم سجلات تطعيم من بلدانهم الأصلية. هذه السجلات قيمة ويمكن أن تقلل من عدد التطعيمات التي تحتاجها أثناء الفحص. ومع ذلك، يجب أن تكون السجلات بالعربية أو اللغات الأخرى مصحوبة بترجمات إنجليزية معتمدة. قد يقبل جراحك المدني السجلات بلغتها الأصلية إذا تمكن من قراءتها، لكن إعداد الترجمات مستحسن.</p>

        <h2>عملية الفحص البدني</h2>

          <li><strong>موانع طبية:</strong> إذا كان اللقاح ضاراً بصحتك، قد يُمنح إعفاء مع توثيق من طبيبك</li>
          <li><strong>اعتراض ديني أو أخلاقي:</strong> قد تتوفر إعفاءات للاعتراضات الدينية أو الأخلاقية الصادقة، رغم أن الموافقة ليست مضمونة</li>
          <li><strong>غير مناسب للعمر:</strong> اللقاحات غير الموصى بها لفئتك العمرية غير مطلوبة</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>متطلبات اختبار السل (TB)</h2>
        <p>فحص السل هو أحد أهم مكونات الفحص الطبي للهجرة. تأخذ الولايات المتحدة الوقاية من السل على محمل الجد بسبب طبيعته المعدية وآثاره على الصحة العامة.</p>

        <h3>أنواع اختبارات السل</h3>
        <p>قد يستخدم الجراحون المدنيون إحدى طريقتي الاختبار المعتمدتين:</p>

        <h4>اختبار الجلد للسل (TST) - اختبار مانتو</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>يُحقن كمية صغيرة من مادة الاختبار تحت جلد ساعدك</li>
          <li>يجب أن تعود بعد 48-72 ساعة لقراءة النتيجة</li>
          <li>يقيس الطبيب أي تفاعل في موقع الحقن</li>
          <li>يتطلب هذا الاختبار زيارتين للإكمال</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>اختبار إطلاق الإنترفيرون غاما (IGRA) - اختبار الدم</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>تُسحب عينة دم وتُرسل إلى المختبر</li>
          <li>تتوفر النتائج عادةً في غضون أيام قليلة</li>
          <li>مطلوبة زيارة واحدة فقط للاختبار نفسه</li>
          <li>عموماً أغلى من اختبار الجلد</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ماذا يحدث إذا كان اختبار السل إيجابياً؟</h3>
        <p>اختبار السل الإيجابي لا يعني تلقائياً أن لديك سلاً نشطاً. كثير من الناس لديهم عدوى سل كامنة، مما يعني أن البكتيريا موجودة لكنها غير نشطة. إذا كان اختبار السل إيجابياً:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>الأشعة السينية للصدر مطلوبة:</strong> ستحتاج لأشعة سينية للصدر للتحقق من علامات مرض السل النشط</li>
          <li><strong>تقييم الأعراض:</strong> سيسأل الجراح المدني عن أعراض مثل السعال والحمى وفقدان الوزن والتعرق الليلي</li>
          <li><strong>اختبار البلغم المحتمل:</strong> إذا أظهرت الأشعة السينية تشوهات أو لديك أعراض، قد يكون هناك حاجة لاختبارات إضافية</li>
          <li><strong>قد يكون العلاج مطلوباً:</strong> إذا وُجد سل نشط، يجب إكمال العلاج قبل الموافقة على الهجرة</li>
          <li><strong>السل الكامن:</strong> إذا كان لديك سل كامن (اختبار إيجابي لكن أشعة سينية سلبية وبدون أعراض)، يمكنك الاستمرار في الهجرة لكن قد تحتاج لإكمال العلاج</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>اعتبارات خاصة لتطعيم BCG</h3>
        <p>تلقى العديد من المهاجرين العرب تطعيم BCG (عصية كالميت غيران) في بلدانهم الأصلية. هذا اللقاح، الشائع في دول الشرق الأوسط، يمكن أن يسبب تفاعلات إيجابية كاذبة على اختبار الجلد للسل. إذا تلقيت تطعيم BCG:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>قد يُفضل اختبار الدم IGRA لأنه لا يتأثر بتطعيم BCG</li>
          <li>أبلغ جراحك المدني عن تاريخ تطعيم BCG الخاص بك</li>
          <li>أحضر أي توثيق لتطعيم BCG إذا كان متاحاً</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>تقييم الصحة النفسية والسلوكية</h2>
        <p>يتضمن الفحص الطبي للهجرة تقييماً للصحة النفسية والسلوك. تم تصميم هذا التقييم لتحديد الحالات التي قد تؤثر على القبول بموجب الأسس الصحية.</p>

        <h3>ما يتضمنه التقييم</h3>
        <p>يتضمن تقييم الصحة النفسية عادةً:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>أسئلة حول تاريخ صحتك النفسية</li>
          <li>استفسار عن أي تشخيصات أو علاجات نفسية</li>
          <li>تقييم الحالة النفسية الحالية</li>
          <li>أسئلة حول استخدام المواد والتاريخ</li>
          <li>تقييم أي مخاوف سلوكية</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>الحالات التي قد تتطلب تقييماً إضافياً</h3>
        <p>قد تتطلب حالات معينة توثيقاً أو تقييماً إضافياً:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>تاريخ علاج الصحة النفسية:</strong> دخول المستشفى النفسي السابق أو العلاج المستمر</li>
          <li><strong>اضطرابات استخدام المواد:</strong> تاريخ تعاطي المخدرات أو الكحول</li>
          <li><strong>المخاوف السلوكية:</strong> تاريخ العنف أو السلوك الضار</li>
        </ul>

        <p>وجود حالة صحية نفسية لا يجعلك غير مقبول تلقائياً. يركز التقييم على ما إذا كانت أي حالة تشكل تهديداً لنفسك أو للآخرين أو قد تؤدي إلى سلوك ضار.</p>

        <h2>فترة صلاحية I-693 واعتبارات التوقيت</h2>
        <p>فهم فترة صلاحية نموذج I-693 أمر بالغ الأهمية للتوقيت المناسب لفحصك الطبي. قواعد الصلاحية محددة ويجب اتباعها بعناية لتجنب الحاجة إلى فحص متكرر.</p>

        <h3>قواعد الصلاحية الحالية</h3>
        <p>وفقاً لإرشادات USCIS الحالية:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>صلاحية سنتين:</strong> نموذج I-693 صالح لمدة سنتين من تاريخ توقيع الجراح المدني عليه</li>
          <li><strong>التوقيت بالنسبة لـ I-485:</strong> يجب ألا يكون تاريخ توقيع الجراح المدني أكثر من 60 يوماً قبل تقديم نموذج I-485</li>
          <li><strong>يجب أن يكون صالحاً عند البت:</strong> يجب أن يكون I-693 لا يزال صالحاً عندما تتخذ USCIS قراراً بشأن طلب بطاقتك الخضراء</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>توصيات التوقيت الاستراتيجي</h3>
        <p>نظراً لفترة الصلاحية، ضع في اعتبارك هذه الاستراتيجيات:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>انتظر حتى يكون I-485 معلقاً:</strong> يختار بعض المتقدمين الانتظار حتى يتم تقديم I-485 قبل إكمال الفحص الطبي، رغم أن هذا قد يؤخر المعالجة</li>
          <li><strong>قدم مع I-485:</strong> تقديم I-693 مع طلب I-485 الأولي يمكن أن يبسط المعالجة</li>
          <li><strong>راقب أوقات المعالجة:</strong> ضع في اعتبارك أوقات معالجة USCIS الحالية عند تحديد موعد إكمال فحصك</li>
          <li><strong>خطط للتأخيرات المحتملة:</strong> إذا توقعت أن قضيتك ستستغرق أكثر من عامين، ناقش التوقيت مع محاميك</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h4>ملاحظة توقيت مهمة</h4>
          <p>إذا انتهت صلاحية I-693 قبل أن تبت USCIS في قضيتك، ستتلقى طلب دليل (RFE) يطلب فحصاً طبياً جديداً. هذا يعني تكاليف ووقتاً إضافيين. التخطيط المناسب للتوقيت يمكن أن يساعد في تجنب هذا الموقف.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>الظرف المختوم: فهم التعامل الصحيح</h2>
        <p>بعد إكمال فحصك الطبي، سيزودك الجراح المدني بنموذج I-693 المكتمل في ظرف مختوم. التعامل الصحيح مع هذا الظرف مهم للغاية.</p>

        <h3>قواعد التعامل مع الظرف المختوم</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>لا تفتح الظرف:</strong> تحت أي ظرف يجب ألا تفتح الظرف المختوم. الظرف المفتوح لن يُقبل من قبل USCIS</li>
          <li><strong>احتفظ به بأمان:</strong> خزّن الظرف في مكان آمن حيث لن يتضرر</li>
          <li><strong>قدمه مغلقاً:</strong> عند تقديم I-485 أو الرد على RFE، ضمّن الظرف المغلق غير المفتوح</li>
          <li><strong>اطلب نسخة:</strong> اطلب من جراحك المدني نسخة غير مختومة لسجلاتك الشخصية قبل إعداد الظرف المختوم</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ماذا لو فُتح الظرف أو تضرر؟</h3>
        <p>إذا فُتح ظرفك المختوم عن طريق الخطأ أو تضرر:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>اتصل بالجراح المدني فوراً</li>
          <li>ستحتاج على الأرجح للعودة لإعداد ظرف مختوم جديد</li>
          <li>قد تكون هناك رسوم إضافية لهذه الخدمة</li>
          <li>لا تحاول إعادة ختم الظرف بنفسك</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>الحالات الطبية التي قد تؤثر على الموافقة على البطاقة الخضراء</h2>
        <p>يمكن لبعض الحالات الطبية أن تؤثر على قبولك في الولايات المتحدة. فهم هذه الحالات وكيفية تقييمها يمكن أن يساعدك في التحضير للمشاكل المحتملة.</p>

        <h3>حالات الفئة أ (غير مقبول)</h3>
        <p>حالات الفئة أ هي تلك التي تجعل المتقدم غير مقبول في الولايات المتحدة بدون إعفاء:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>الأمراض المعدية ذات الأهمية للصحة العامة:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>السل النشط</li>
              <li>الزهري (المرحلة المعدية)</li>
              <li>السيلان</li>
              <li>الجذام (المعدي)</li>
              <li>أمراض أخرى كما يحددها مركز السيطرة على الأمراض</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>عدم إظهار التطعيمات المطلوبة:</strong> عدم الحصول على التطعيمات المطلوبة بدون إعفاء معتمد</li>
          <li><strong>الاضطرابات الجسدية أو النفسية مع سلوك ضار:</strong> الاضطرابات المرتبطة بسلوك يشكل تهديداً للنفس أو للآخرين أو للممتلكات</li>
          <li><strong>تعاطي المخدرات أو الإدمان:</strong> تعاطي المخدرات الحالي أو الإدمان كما يحدده الجراح المدني</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>حالات الفئة ب (غير غير مقبول لكن موثقة)</h3>
        <p>حالات الفئة ب هي حالات صحية مهمة موثقة لكنها لا تجعلك غير مقبول:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>الحالات الجسدية أو النفسية التي قد تتطلب علاجاً لكنها لا تشكل تهديداً</li>
          <li>الأمراض المزمنة تحت السيطرة</li>
          <li>الإعاقات الجسدية</li>
          <li>حالات الصحة النفسية المُدارة بالعلاج</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>إعفاءات لأسس عدم القبول الطبية</h3>
        <p>إذا كانت لديك حالة من الفئة أ، قد تتوفر إعفاءات في ظروف معينة. يعتمد توفر الإعفاء على الحالة المحددة وظروفك الفردية. يمكن لمحامي الهجرة لدينا المساعدة في تقييم ما إذا كان الإعفاء متاحاً في قضيتك.</p>

        <h2>التكاليف والرسوم للفحص الطبي للهجرة</h2>
        <p>يمكن أن تختلف تكلفة الفحص الطبي للهجرة بشكل كبير اعتماداً على الجراح المدني والموقع والخدمات المطلوبة. فهم التكاليف المحتملة يمكن أن يساعدك في وضع الميزانية بشكل مناسب.</p>

        <h2>الأسئلة الشائعة</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>كم من الوقت يستغرق الفحص الطبي للهجرة؟</h3>
          <p>يستغرق موعد الفحص الأولي عادةً 30-60 دقيقة. ومع ذلك، إذا كنت بحاجة لاختبار الجلد للسل، ستحتاج للعودة بعد 48-72 ساعة لقراءة النتيجة. إذا كانت هناك حاجة للتطعيمات، يُطلب وقت إضافي. تستغرق العملية بأكملها من الموعد الأول إلى استلام ظرفك المختوم عادةً 1-2 أسبوع، رغم أن هذا قد يختلف بناءً على نتائج الاختبار وجداول التطعيم.</p>

          <h3>هل يمكنني استخدام طبيبي العادي للفحص الطبي للهجرة؟</h3>
          <p>لا، فقط الجراحون المدنيون المعينون من USCIS يمكنهم إجراء الفحص الطبي للهجرة وإكمال نموذج I-693. لا يمكن لطبيبك العادي إكمال هذا النموذج حتى لو كان مستعداً للقيام بذلك. ومع ذلك، يمكنك أن تطلب من طبيبك العادي نسخاً من سجلاتك الطبية وتاريخ التطعيم لإحضارها للجراح المدني، مما قد يوفر الوقت ويقلل التكاليف.</p>

          <h3>ماذا يحدث إذا كنت حاملاً أثناء فحصي الطبي؟</h3>
          <p>الحمل لا يمنعك من إكمال الفحص الطبي للهجرة. ومع ذلك، قد يتم تعديل أو تأخير بعض التطعيمات والاختبارات بسبب الحمل. سيقوم الجراح المدني بإجراء التعديلات المناسبة وتوثيق أي لقاحات مؤجلة بسبب الحمل. قد يُطلب منك إكمال تلك التطعيمات بعد الولادة.</p>

          <h3>هل يحتاج أطفالي إلى فحوصات طبية منفصلة؟</h3>
          <p>نعم، كل شخص يتقدم للحصول على بطاقة خضراء، بغض النظر عن العمر، يجب أن يخضع لفحصه الطبي الخاص. يخضع الأطفال والرضع لمتطلبات مناسبة للعمر، مما يعني أنهم لن يحصلوا على تطعيمات أو اختبارات غير موصى بها لفئتهم العمرية. سيحتاج كل فرد من أفراد الأسرة إلى نموذج I-693 الخاص به مكتملاً من قبل جراح مدني.</p>

          <h3>ما هي مدة صلاحية نموذج I-693؟</h3>
          <p>نموذج I-693 صالح لمدة سنتين من تاريخ توقيع الجراح المدني على النموذج. يجب أن يكون تاريخ توقيع الجراح المدني في موعد لا يتجاوز 60 يوماً قبل تقديم طلب I-485. إذا انتهت صلاحية I-693 قبل أن تقرر USCIS في قضيتك، ستحتاج للحصول على فحص طبي جديد، مما يعني تكاليف وتأخيرات إضافية.</p>

          <h3>ماذا لو كانت لدي حالة طبية تتطلب علاجاً مستمراً؟</h3>
          <p>وجود حالة طبية مزمنة تتطلب علاجاً مستمراً لا يجعلك غير مقبول تلقائياً. العديد من الحالات، بما في ذلك السكري وأمراض القلب وحالات الصحة النفسية المُدارة بالأدوية، تُصنف كحالات من الفئة ب، والتي تُوثق لكنها لا تمنع الموافقة على البطاقة الخضراء. العامل الرئيسي هو ما إذا كانت الحالة تشكل تهديداً للسلامة أو الصحة العامة.</p>

          <h3>هل يمكنني رفض تطعيمات معينة لأسباب دينية؟</h3>
          <p>يمكنك طلب إعفاء للتطعيمات بناءً على قناعات دينية أو أخلاقية. ومع ذلك، الموافقة غير مضمونة وتخضع لتقدير USCIS. يجب إثبات معتقدات دينية أو أخلاقية صادقة تعارض التطعيمات. نادراً ما تُمنح إعفاءات شاملة لجميع اللقاحات، وقد يكون الحصول على إعفاءات لبعض اللقاحات (مثل تلك التي تمنع الأمراض شديدة العدوى) أكثر صعوبة.</p>

          <h3>ما هي الوثائق التي يجب إحضارها إذا كانت سجلات التطعيم بالعربية؟</h3>
          <p>إذا كانت سجلات التطعيم بالعربية، يجب إحضار الوثائق الأصلية والترجمات الإنجليزية المعتمدة. بينما قد يتمكن بعض الجراحين المدنيين من قراءة السجلات العربية، فإن إعداد الترجمات يضمن عدم وجود سوء فهم ويسرع العملية. خدمات الترجمة متوفرة من خلال مترجمين معتمدين، ويمكن لمكتبنا تقديم إحالات إذا لزم الأمر.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>التحضير لمقابلة البطاقة الخضراء بعد الفحص الطبي</h2>
        <p>بمجرد اكتمال فحصك الطبي وجاهزية نموذج I-693، أنت على بعد خطوة واحدة من مقابلة بطاقتك الخضراء. تصبح نتائج الفحص الطبي جزءاً من ملف الهجرة الخاص بك وقد تُراجع أثناء مقابلتك.</p>

        <h3>ما يمكن توقعه في المقابلة فيما يتعلق بالمسائل الطبية</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>قد يسأل الموظف إذا كانت هناك أي تغييرات في صحتك منذ الفحص</li>
          <li>إذا كانت هناك أي نتائج من الفئة ب، قد يُسأل عن الحالة</li>
          <li>أحضر أي توثيق طبي إضافي متعلق بالحالات المستمرة</li>
          <li>كن مستعداً لمناقشة أي تطعيمات تم تأجيلها</li>
        </ul>
