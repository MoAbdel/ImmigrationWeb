          a: "Yes, social media criticism can form the basis for asylum if it caused or could cause persecution. Document your posts, any threats received, and explain why the government or militias would target you for this expression. Screenshots and account records are important evidence."

        {
          q: "What if I participated in the Tishreen protests?",
          a: "Participation in the October 2019 protest movement (Tishreen) is strong basis for asylum given documented government and militia violence against protesters. Document your specific participation, any injuries or threats, and any ongoing targeting since the protests."

          q: "Do I need a lawyer for asylum?",

          q: "What if I missed the one-year deadline?",

        {
          q: "Can I travel outside the U.S. while my asylum case is pending?",
          a: "Traveling abroad while asylum is pending is extremely risky and generally not recommended. Leaving could be considered abandoning your claim. After approval, travel back to Iraq could jeopardize your status. Consult an attorney before any international travel."

        {
          q: "What if the militia that threatened me isn't part of the government?",
          a: "You can still qualify for asylum if persecuted by non-government groups that the government is unable or unwilling to control. Iraq's militias often operate with impunity, and we can document that the government cannot protect you from them."
        },
        {
          q: "How long does Iraqi asylum take?",
          a: "Current processing times vary significantly. Initial interview scheduling can take 6-18 months. After interview, decisions typically come within 2-8 weeks. If referred to court, cases can take 2-4 additional years. Work authorization helps you support yourself during this time."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my family in Iraq be brought here after I get asylum?",
          a: "Yes, within 2 years of asylum approval, you can file Form I-730 to bring your spouse and unmarried children under 21. They would receive derivative asylee status. This is called \"following-to-join\" and doesn't require them to prove their own persecution."
