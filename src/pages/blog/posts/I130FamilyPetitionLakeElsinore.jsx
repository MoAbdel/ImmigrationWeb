          question: 'How long does the I-130 petition process take?',
          answer: 'I-130 processing time varies by relationship category and current USCIS workload. Immediate relative petitions (spouse, unmarried child under 21, parent of adult citizen) process in 5-12 months. Preference category petitions process in similar timeframes, but visa availability requires additional waiting: F2A (spouse/child of green card holder) waits 2-3 years; F1 (unmarried adult child of citizen) waits 7-8 years; F2B (unmarried adult child of LPR) waits 6-9 years; F3 (married child of citizen) waits 12-15 years; F4 (sibling of citizen) waits 15-24 years. Country-specific backlogs add additional time for applicants from Mexico, Philippines, India, and China.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I sponsor my parents for green cards?',
          answer: 'Yes, U.S. citizens who are 21 years or older can sponsor their parents for green cards. Parents qualify as immediate relatives, meaning no visa number limits or waiting periods apply. After filing Form I-130, processing typically takes 5-12 months before the case moves to the National Visa Center. Both mother and father require separate I-130 petitions. Green card holders cannot petition for parents; you must naturalize first. Stepparents can be petitioned if the marriage creating the stepparent relationship occurred before you turned 18.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What happens if my I-130 petition is denied?',
          answer: 'If USCIS denies your I-130, the denial notice explains the reason and appeal options. Common denial reasons include insufficient evidence of relationship, ineligible family relationship, or petitioner status issues. You can file Form I-290B (Notice of Appeal) within 30 days to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO). Alternatively, you can file a motion to reopen (with new evidence) or motion to reconsider (arguing USCIS made legal error). Many denials result from fixable documentation issues. Consulting an immigration attorney helps evaluate whether to appeal, file motions, or submit a new petition with stronger evidence.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can a green card holder sponsor a spouse?',
          answer: 'Yes, green card holders (permanent residents) can sponsor spouses for green cards through Form I-130. Spouses of green card holders fall into the F2A preference category, which has annual visa limits. Current wait times for F2A range from 2-3 years depending on the beneficiary\'s country of birth. During the waiting period, the spouse may remain abroad or, if legally present in the U.S., may be able to adjust status when a visa becomes available. If the green card holder naturalizes to become a U.S. citizen while the case is pending, the spouse upgrades to immediate relative status with no waiting period.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do I need a lawyer to file I-130?',
          answer: 'While legal representation is not legally required for I-130 petitions, working with an experienced immigration attorney significantly improves outcomes. Attorneys help ensure forms are completed correctly, compile comprehensive evidence packages, identify potential issues before filing, respond effectively to Requests for Evidence, and navigate complex situations like prior immigration violations or criminal history. For straightforward immediate relative cases, some people successfully file themselves. However, any complications in family history, documentation, or immigration background warrant professional guidance. SoCal Immigration Services offers consultations to assess your specific situation.'

          heading: 'مشاكل I-130 الشائعة والحلول',
          content: `تواجه كثير من عرائض I-130 تحديات تؤخر أو تمنع الموافقة.

**دليل علاقة غير كافٍ:**
- المشكلة: USCIS تشك في العلاقة الحقيقية
- الحل: قدم حزمة أدلة شاملة
- قضايا الزواج: مالية مشتركة، صور، إفادات

**انتهاكات هجرة سابقة:**
- المشكلة: المستفيد لديه إقامة غير قانونية
- قد تُطبق عقوبات الحظر (3 سنوات، 10 سنوات، دائم)
- الحل: استشر محامياً حول الإعفاءات (I-601)

**تاريخ جنائي:**
- المشكلة: مقدم العريضة أو المستفيد لديه سجل جنائي
- جرائم معينة تجعل المستفيد غير مقبول
- الحل: راجع التهم المحددة مع محامٍ

**مخاوف احتيال الزواج:**
- المشكلة: USCIS تشك أن الزواج مزيف
- الحل: وثّق العلاقة بدقة
- المقابلات تختبر الطرفين بشكل منفصل

**عدم كفاية مالية:**
- المشكلة: مقدم العريضة لا يستطيف تلبية متطلبات الدخل
- الحل: استخدم كفيل مشترك إذا لزم الأمر
- أرفق الأصول لتكملة الدخل`

- يمكن تقديم عريضة ذاتية إذا كانوا متزوجين من مواطن أمريكي
- يجب التقديم خلال سنتين من وفاة الزوج
