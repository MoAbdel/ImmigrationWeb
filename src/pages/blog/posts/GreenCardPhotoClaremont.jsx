These requirements ensure accurate biometric identification and document security. Photos that fail to meet these standards result in automatic rejection of your application package.\n\nUSCIS updated their photo requirements in 2023, removing the glasses restriction for most applicants and clarifying religious attire guidelines. These changes benefit many Arab immigrants who wear prescription glasses or religious head coverings.\n\nEvery photo submitted to USCIS undergoes automated quality checks before human review. The system scans for proper dimensions, lighting, background color, and facial positioning. Photos that pass automated screening then receive manual review for expression, attire, and overall compliance.\n\nClaremont applicants submit photos for Form I-485 (Adjustment of Status), Form N-400 (Naturalization), Form I-90 (Green Card Renewal), Form I-130 (Family Petition), and many other immigration applications. Each form requires identical photo specifications."

The lighting must reveal natural skin tones without overexposure or underexposure.\n\nShadow Prevention: Professional photographers use multiple light sources to eliminate shadows. A shadow on the background, even a faint one, causes rejection. Shadows on the face, particularly around the eyes or under religious head coverings, also trigger rejection.\n\nContrast Requirements: Sufficient contrast between your face, clothing, and the background. Applicants wearing white clothing may need to adjust to create proper contrast against the white background.\n\nColor Accuracy: The photo must accurately represent your natural skin tone, hair color, and eye color.

Proper lighting from multiple angles prevents shadow formation under the fabric edges. Many standard photo booths fail this requirement.\n\nThe entire face must remain visible from the bottom of the chin to the top of the forehead. The hijab cannot cover any portion of the face itself, including the hairline if typically visible.\n\nBoth ears do not need to be visible when wearing hijab. This is a common misconception - USCIS does not require ear visibility for religious head covering wearers.\n\nThe hijab color does not matter, but dark colors photograph better against white backgrounds. Very light-colored hijabs may blend with the background.\n\nYou may be asked to provide a signed statement explaining that you wear the head covering for religious reasons. This statement should reference your religious practice and is typically a simple one-sentence declaration.\n\nImportant: USCIS officers cannot require you to remove religious head coverings. If any government official requests removal of your hijab for a photo, you have the right to refuse and request accommodation.

This exception requires documentation from a medical professional explaining why glasses cannot be removed. Conditions that may qualify include recent eye surgery, severe light sensitivity, or certain eye conditions.\n\nTo obtain a medical exception:\n\n1. Get a signed statement from your ophthalmologist or optometrist\n2. The statement must explain why glasses cannot be removed for photographs\n3. Include the statement with your application\n4. The glasses must not create glare or reflections in the photo\n5. Eyes must be clearly visible through the lenses\n\nMany Claremont applicants who previously wore glasses in their photos are surprised by this requirement.

The most common technique involves laying the baby on a plain white sheet or blanket.\n\nThe baby's eyes should be open if possible, but USCIS accepts photos of very young infants with closed eyes when keeping eyes open is not achievable.\n\nThe infant does not need to have a neutral expression. Natural baby expressions are accepted.\n\nNo pacifiers, bottles, or toys may appear in the photo.\n\nThe infant's head does not need to be perfectly centered if maintaining position is difficult.\n\nChildren Ages 1-5:\n\nChildren must have both eyes open and visible. No crying expressions. The child should face the camera directly.\n\nParents often need multiple photo attempts. Professional photographers experienced with children achieve better results than standard photo booths.\n\nThe child may sit in a car seat covered with a white sheet, with the seat edited out of the final image.\n\nChildren Ages 6-15:\n\nStandard adult photo requirements apply, but some leniency exists for minor expression variations.\n\nChildren must remove hats, headbands, and hair accessories unless worn for religious or medical reasons.\n\nTeenagers should follow all adult photo requirements precisely.",

Staff may not be familiar with religious head covering requirements.\n\nWalgreens: Similar service to CVS. Locations throughout the Claremont area. Prices comparable. Quality inconsistent between locations.\n\nCostco Photo Centers: Costco in Azusa or Montclair offers immigration photos at lower prices ($6.99 for two prints). Requires membership. Staff experience with USCIS requirements varies.\n\nUSPS (Post Office): The Claremont Post Office and nearby USPS locations offer passport photos that meet USCIS standards. Higher prices ($15-20) but staff receive specific training on government photo requirements.\n\nProfessional Photography Studios: Independent photographers in Claremont and surrounding cities offer the highest quality results. Expect to pay $25-50 but receive guaranteed USCIS-compliant photos. Many offer retakes at no additional charge.\n\nAAA Offices: AAA members can get passport photos at local offices. Staff typically have good training on requirements.\n\nSoCal Immigration Services Recommendation: We advise Claremont clients to use professional photographers or USPS locations for immigration photos, especially when wearing religious head coverings.

Avoid heavy compression that creates visible artifacts.\n\nHow to Get Digital Photos:\n\nMost photo locations provide both printed and digital copies. Request the digital file when getting photos taken.\n\nScanning printed photos is not recommended - scans rarely meet quality requirements. Original digital capture produces better results.\n\nSmartphone photos can meet requirements if:\n- Taken against a plain white background\n- Proper lighting without shadows\n- High-resolution camera (12 megapixels minimum)\n- Image cropped to square format at correct dimensions\n- No filters or editing applied\n\nOnline Photo Services: Websites like ePassportPhoto.com or IDPhoto4You.com help format photos to USCIS specifications.

Common when photographed near windows or with single light source.\n\n4. Glasses Worn: Unless medically documented exception, photos with any type of glasses are rejected immediately.\n\n5. Improper Head Position: Head tilted, turned, or not facing directly at camera. Face must be square to the camera.\n\n6. Expression Problems: Mouth open, smiling showing teeth, frowning, or exaggerated expressions. Neutral expression with closed mouth required.\n\n7. Eyes Not Visible: Eyes closed, looking away from camera, hair covering eyes, or glare obscuring eyes.\n\n8. Head Size Wrong: Face too large or too small in frame. Head must occupy 50-69% of photo height.\n\n9. Photo Quality: Blurry, pixelated, over-exposed, under-exposed, or poor color accuracy.\n\n10.
