      locationIntro: "Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley have become home to a growing community of Arab-American families seeking to reunite with parents left behind in their home countries. Whether you live in Palm Springs, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, or the surrounding desert communities, bringing your parents to enjoy their golden years in this beautiful region is a meaningful goal. As a U.S. citizen, you have the privilege of sponsoring your parents as immediate relatives, which means no visa wait times.",
      summary: "U.S. citizens can petition for their parents using Form I-130 as immediate relatives, which provides the fastest path to a green card with no annual visa limits or waiting periods. Parents can either adjust status if in the U.S. or process through a consulate abroad. The process typically takes 12-18 months and requires proof of the parent-child relationship and financial ability to support your parents.",

          a: "No, only U.S. citizens can petition for parents. Green card holders cannot sponsor parents for immigration. If you're a permanent resident, you must first naturalize and become a U.S. citizen before you can file an I-130 for your parents. This is one of the key benefits of citizenship that many people seek."

          q: "How long does it take to bring parents to the U.S. from the Middle East?",
          a: "The total process typically takes 15-25 months from filing the I-130 to your parents receiving their immigrant visas. This includes 12-18 months for USCIS I-130 processing, 2-4 months at the National Visa Center, and 1-3 months for the consular interview. Processing from Middle Eastern countries may have additional administrative processing time."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I sponsor both parents at the same time?",
          a: "Yes, you can and should sponsor both parents simultaneously by filing separate I-130 petitions for each parent. Each petition requires its own filing fee ($535 each). Filing together ensures both parents go through the process at the same pace and can travel to the U.S. together."
        },
        {
          q: "What if I can't meet the income requirement for the Affidavit of Support?",
          a: "If your income doesn't meet 125% of poverty guidelines for your household size, you have options. You can use a joint sponsor who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident with sufficient income. You can also count assets (savings, property) at a rate of 3:1 to supplement income. A joint sponsor takes on equal legal responsibility to support your parents."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my parents work when they arrive in the United States?",
          a: "Yes. When your parents enter the U.S. with their immigrant visas, they become lawful permanent residents immediately. Their green cards will arrive by mail within a few weeks. As permanent residents, they have authorization to work for any employer in the United States without needing a separate work permit."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if my parent has a medical condition?",
          a: "All immigrant visa applicants must undergo a medical examination. Certain health conditions can make a person inadmissible, including communicable diseases and lack of required vaccinations. Most conditions can be resolved through treatment or waivers. If your parent has a serious health condition, discuss this with an immigration professional before filing."
