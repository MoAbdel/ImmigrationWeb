Whether you live near Cal State San Marcos, the residential areas along San Marcos Boulevard, or the communities near Discovery Street, this guide provides essential information about asylum protection and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Sudanese nationals. The conflict that erupted in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces has displaced millions, and the U.S. has recognized Sudan for TPS designation, providing critical protection for those already in America.",

However, you may still qualify for asylum if you have a well-founded fear of persecution. You must file for asylum within one year of your arrival date.

This includes dated photographs, medical or dental records, school records, employment records, bank statements, lease agreements, utility bills, or dated receipts. Even social media posts with location data can help. If you lack traditional documentation, affidavits from people who can attest to your presence may supplement other evidence."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if my TPS application is denied?",
          a: "If your TPS application is denied, you may be placed in removal proceedings if you have no other legal status. You can appeal certain denials or file a motion to reopen if there was an error. Having an immigration attorney review your case before denial becomes final is critical. If denied for discretionary reasons, you may still pursue asylum or other forms of relief."

          q: "Can I travel outside the U.S. with TPS?",
          a: "TPS holders must obtain advance parole (travel permission) before leaving the United States. File Form I-131 and receive approval before travel. Leaving without advance parole can result in denial of re-entry and loss of TPS. Travel to Sudan while holding TPS based on Sudan conditions may raise questions about your need for protection. Consult with an immigration attorney before any international travel."
        },
        {
          q: "How long does it take to get TPS approved?",
          a: "TPS processing times vary but typically range from 3-12 months. During this time, if you filed Form I-765 for employment authorization, you may receive work authorization before your TPS is fully adjudicated. USCIS provides automatic extensions for those who timely re-register, ensuring continuous protection while applications are processed."
        },
        {
          q: "What documents do I need from Sudan for my application?",
          a: "Key documents include your passport, national ID card, birth certificate, or any other official Sudanese document proving nationality. If you cannot obtain documents from Sudan due to the conflict, you can provide secondary evidence such as affidavits from community members who know you, school records, or other identity documents. Explain in your application why primary documents are unavailable."
        },
        {
          q: "Is my asylum case stronger because of the current conflict in Sudan?",
          a: "The current conflict strengthens country conditions evidence for Sudanese asylum cases, but you must still demonstrate individual persecution or fear of persecution. Simply being from Sudan is not enough. You need to show why you specifically would be targeted based on your ethnicity, political opinion, religion, or other protected ground. The widespread violence supports claims but does not replace individual evidence."
