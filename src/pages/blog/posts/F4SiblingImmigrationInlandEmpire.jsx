      locationIntro: "The Inland Empire, spanning Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, is home to thousands of Arab-American families who dream of reuniting with siblings left behind in their home countries. Cities like Fontana, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, Moreno Valley, and Corona have vibrant Arab communities where family bonds remain strong despite the distance. Unfortunately, the F4 sibling category has the longest wait times of any family immigration category, requiring careful long-term planning.",
      summary: "The F4 category allows U.S. citizens to petition for siblings (brothers and sisters), but wait times currently exceed 15-24 years depending on country of birth. Filing early is essential as the wait is based on when the I-130 is filed (priority date). Siblings can remain in the U.S. through other means while waiting if they have valid status, but most wait abroad. Strategic planning helps families navigate this lengthy process.",

Additionally, no single country can receive more than 7% of total family visas, creating extra backlogs for high-demand countries. With millions of approved petitions waiting for visas, new petitions go to the back of a very long line."
        },
        {
          q: "Should I file now or wait until I have more money?",
          a: "File now. The filing fee is $535, and every day you wait adds another day to your sibling's wait. If you filed today, your priority date would be January 2026. If you wait a year, your priority date would be January 2027, meaning your sibling waits one extra year. Early filing is the most important decision in F4 cases."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my sibling work in the U.S. while waiting for the F4 visa?",
          a: "The F4 petition itself does not provide any work authorization or status in the U.S. If your sibling is already in the U.S. with valid status (student, work visa, etc.), they can maintain that status. If abroad, they must wait abroad until the priority date is current. There is no 'in-between' status for F4 beneficiaries."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if I die before my sibling gets their visa?",
          a: "If the petitioner dies, the case may continue under the Family Unity provisions if certain conditions are met, such as having a substitute sponsor and the sibling having resided in the U.S. or having other qualifying relatives. An immigration attorney should be consulted if this situation arises."
        },
        {
          q: "My sibling's child will turn 21 during the wait. What can I do?",
          a: "The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) may help. CSPA allows you to subtract the time the I-130 was pending from the child's age. If the adjusted age is under 21 when the priority date becomes current, the child may be protected. The child must also seek to acquire the visa within one year of availability. This is complex - consult an immigration professional."
        },
        {
          q: "Can filing for a sibling help them visit the U.S. while waiting?",
          a: "The pending I-130 petition does not help obtain a tourist visa and may actually make it harder. A pending immigrant petition shows immigrant intent, which can be grounds for denying a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. Your sibling must demonstrate strong ties to their home country and intent to return. The F4 petition is for eventual immigration, not visiting."
