When a U.S. citizen files a K-1 fiancé visa petition for their foreign fiancé, the children of that fiancé can also come to America through the K-2 derivative visa. SoCal Immigration Services provides comprehensive Arabic-speaking assistance to help families navigate this important process and keep children together with their parents.",

          content: "The K-2 derivative visa allows the unmarried children (under 21) of K-1 fiancé visa holders to accompany their parent to the United States. This visa category ensures that families stay together during the immigration process, recognizing that separating children from their parents during this transition causes unnecessary hardship.\n\nKey Facts About K-2 Visas:\n• K-2 is specifically for children of K-1 fiancé visa holders\n• Children must be unmarried and under 21 years old\n• K-2 applicants travel with or follow their K-1 parent\n• The U.S. citizen petitioner does not need to adopt the children\n• K-2 holders can adjust status to permanent residents after the marriage\n• There is no separate petition fee for K-2 applicants\n\nThe K-2 visa provides a direct pathway for children to join their parent who is marrying a U.S. citizen. Without this derivative category, children would face lengthy separation from their parent or require a completely separate immigration process that takes years longer."

Here is how families in Tustin can ensure children are properly included:\n\nStep 1: Include Children on Form I-129F\nWhen the U.S. citizen files Form I-129F (Petition for Alien Fiancé), all eligible children must be listed. The form has a specific section for derivative beneficiaries. Each child's full name, date of birth, country of birth, and relationship to the fiancé must be accurately documented.\n\nStep 2: Provide Supporting Documentation\nFor each child listed, you must provide birth certificates showing the parent-child relationship, passport copies, and passport-style photographs. If the child was adopted, legal adoption documents are required.\n\nStep 3: USCIS Processing\nUSCIS reviews the entire petition, including all listed children. The approval covers both the K-1 principal beneficiary and all K-2 derivative beneficiaries.\n\nStep 4: National Visa Center (NVC)\nAfter USCIS approval, the case transfers to NVC, which creates separate case numbers for each applicant including K-2 children.\n\nStep 5: Embassy Interview\nEach K-2 child over 14 must attend an interview at the U.S. embassy. Children under 14 may not need to appear but still require complete documentation."

This marriage is essential because K-2 children's ability to adjust status depends on this marriage occurring.\n\nFiling Form I-485 for K-2 Children\nAfter the marriage, each K-2 child files Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status). The child files as a derivative beneficiary based on the parent's relationship to the U.S. citizen.\n\nConcurrent Filings\nK-2 children can file I-485 at the same time as the parent files I-485. This streamlines the process and keeps family cases together.\n\nAdditional Forms:\n• Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization) - for children 14 and older who wish to work\n• Form I-131 (Application for Travel Document) - if child needs to travel while adjustment is pending\n\nConditional vs. Permanent Green Card\nIf the parent was married to the U.S. citizen for less than 2 years when the green card is approved, the child receives a 2-year conditional green card. Form I-751 must be filed to remove conditions before the 2-year period expires.\n\nTimeline After Arrival\nTypical adjustment of status processing for K-2 children takes 12-24 months. During this time, children can attend school, and those over 14 with work authorization can work legally."

This is called 'aging out' and requires exploring alternative immigration pathways.\n\nChild Status Protection Act (CSPA)\nCSPA provides some protection for children who age out during processing. The formula subtracts the time the petition was pending from the child's age. However, CSPA protection for K-2 cases is limited compared to other visa categories.\n\nStrategies to Avoid Aging Out:\n• File I-129F as early as possible when children are approaching 18-19\n• Respond promptly to all USCIS and embassy requests\n• Monitor processing times and consider expedite requests if delays occur\n• If a child is close to 21, consult an immigration professional immediately\n\nFor Tustin families with children approaching 21, early planning is essential. Contact our office to discuss strategies for protecting your child's eligibility."

Children interview at embassy and receive immigrant visas\n\nCritical Stepparent Requirement:\nFor the U.S. citizen to petition for stepchildren, the marriage must occur BEFORE the child turns 18. If the child is already 18+ when the marriage occurs, the stepparent relationship does not qualify for immigration purposes.\n\nWhy K-2 is Almost Always Better:\nThe K-2 derivative visa eliminates years of separation and simplifies the process. Unless there are compelling reasons (child over 21, child chooses to stay, documentation issues), traveling together on K-2 is strongly recommended."

Once aged out, the child would need to wait until their parent becomes a permanent resident, then have their U.S. citizen stepparent file a separate petition - adding years to the process."

          q: "How do I prove my fiancé is the biological parent of the children?",
          a: "The primary document is the child's birth certificate listing your fiancé as a parent. If the birth certificate is in Arabic, a certified English translation is required. If paternity was established separately (such as through court order), those documents must also be provided with translations."

Children 14 and older can file Form I-765 along with their I-485 application. Processing typically takes 3-6 months, after which they can work legally while their green card application is pending."
