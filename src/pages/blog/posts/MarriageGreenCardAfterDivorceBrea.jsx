      locationIntro: "Divorce is difficult enough without worrying about your immigration status. For immigrants in Brea and North Orange County who received their green cards through marriage, a divorce raises important questions about their ability to stay in the United States. The good news is that divorce does not automatically mean losing your green card, but you need to understand your options and act appropriately to protect your status.",
      summary: "Your options after divorce depend on whether you have a conditional (2-year) or permanent (10-year) green card. Conditional residents must file an I-751 waiver to remove conditions without their spouse. Permanent residents keep their green cards after divorce. In cases of abuse, the VAWA self-petition provides a path to safety and status. Taking the right steps protects your immigration future.",

          a: "No, divorce does not automatically lead to deportation. If you have a permanent (10-year) green card, divorce has no effect on your status. If you have a conditional (2-year) green card, you can file an I-751 waiver to remove the conditions based on your good faith marriage, even though it ended. You must take proper steps to protect your status, but deportation is not automatic."
        },
        {
          q: "My spouse refuses to sign the I-751. What do I do?",
          a: "You don't need your spouse's signature if you file an I-751 waiver. The waiver allows you to file alone based on having entered the marriage in good faith. Check the waiver box on the form and explain that you're filing due to divorce (or pending divorce). Include your divorce decree and evidence the marriage was genuine."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my ex-spouse get me deported out of revenge?",
          a: "Your ex-spouse cannot directly cause your deportation. Once you have your green card (conditional or permanent), only USCIS can take action on your status. However, if your ex-spouse claims the marriage was fraudulent, USCIS might investigate. Having strong evidence that your marriage was genuine protects you. If there was abuse, VAWA provides additional protections."
        },
        {
          q: "I'm scared to leave my abusive spouse because of immigration. What are my options?",
          a: "VAWA (Violence Against Women Act) was created specifically to help people in your situation. You can file a self-petition without your spouse's knowledge or cooperation. This gives you a path to legal status independent of your abuser. Contact a domestic violence hotline or immigration professional experienced with VAWA cases for confidential help."
        },
        {
          q: "My conditional green card expired during the divorce. Can I still file I-751?",
          a: "Yes, file the I-751 waiver as soon as possible. USCIS understands that complicated divorces can take time. Include an explanation of why the filing is late (pending divorce proceedings). While late filing is not ideal, it's better than not filing at all. Seek professional help to ensure your application addresses the late filing."
        },
        {
          q: "How soon after divorce can I remarry and sponsor a new spouse?",
          a: "There's no waiting period for remarriage, but immigration implications exist. If you have a conditional green card, focus on your I-751 waiver first. For sponsoring a new spouse, USCIS will scrutinize a very quick remarriage. Having your permanent green card before sponsoring a new spouse is advisable. Wait times for new petitions are also a factor."
