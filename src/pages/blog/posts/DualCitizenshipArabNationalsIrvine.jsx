      locationIntro: "Irvine's professional Arab community includes many immigrants who have built successful lives in the United States while maintaining strong ties to their home countries. When considering U.S. citizenship, a common question is whether you can keep your original citizenship. The answer depends on both U.S. law (which generally permits dual citizenship) and your home country's laws, which vary significantly among Arab nations.",
      summary: "The United States does not require you to give up your original citizenship when naturalizing. However, your home country's laws determine whether you can maintain dual citizenship. Some Arab countries (like Lebanon and Syria) permit dual citizenship, while others (like Saudi Arabia and UAE) generally do not. Understanding both sets of laws is essential before making this important decision.",

          q: "Can I travel to my home country immediately after naturalizing?",
          a: "Generally yes, but proceed carefully. If your country allows dual citizenship, travel with both passports. If your country doesn't allow dual citizenship, you may face complications - some countries may not recognize you as a citizen anymore, while others may still consider you a citizen with obligations. Research your specific country's approach before traveling."

          q: "What happens to my property in my home country if I naturalize?",
          a: "This depends on your home country's laws. In countries that permit dual citizenship, your property rights typically remain intact as a citizen. In countries that don't permit dual citizenship, you may be treated as a foreigner subject to foreign ownership restrictions. Some countries require you to divest property within a certain period. Research this before naturalizing."
        },
        {
          q: "My country revokes citizenship automatically if I naturalize elsewhere. Is it worth it?",
          a: "This is a deeply personal decision. Consider what you gain (U.S. citizenship rights, voting, passport, sponsoring family, government jobs) versus what you lose (home country passport, property rights, ease of travel home, inheritance rights, emotional ties). Some people prioritize U.S. citizenship; others maintain permanent residence to keep original citizenship. There's no universally right answer."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my children have dual citizenship if I do?",
          a: "Generally yes, but rules vary. Children born in the U.S. to immigrant parents are U.S. citizens by birth. Whether they also have your original citizenship depends on your home country's laws - most transmit citizenship to children of citizens regardless of where born. Register your children with your home country's consulate if you want them to have that citizenship too."
        },
        {
          q: "I'm Egyptian and didn't notify my government before naturalizing. What now?",
          a: "Egyptian law technically requires permission before acquiring foreign citizenship. If you naturalized without this, your Egyptian citizenship status may be unclear. Options include: applying for retention retroactively (often successful), continuing to use Egyptian passport and hoping no issues arise, or consulting with an Egyptian immigration lawyer. Many Egyptians naturalize without prior permission and continue traveling to Egypt without problems, but there's some legal risk."
