      locationIntro: "Los Angeles, with its diverse economy spanning entertainment, tech, healthcare, and international business, employs thousands of H-1B workers. When an H-1B petition is denied, both employers and workers face difficult decisions. Understanding your options is critical to making the right choice about appeals, re-filing, or pursuing alternative paths to work authorization.",
      summary: "After an H-1B denial, you have several options: file a motion to reopen or reconsider with USCIS, appeal to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO), file a new petition addressing the denial reasons, or explore alternative visa categories. The best strategy depends on the specific denial reasons, your current status, and your timeline. Acting quickly is essential as denial affects your legal status.",

          q: "Should I appeal or file a new petition?",
          a: "It depends on the denial reason and your timeline. Appeals take 6-18 months and don't guarantee success. A new petition, especially with premium processing, may get a decision in 15 business days. If the denial was based on missing evidence that you now have, a new petition often makes more sense. If USCIS clearly misapplied the law, an appeal may be worthwhile. Many attorneys recommend new petitions over appeals for practical reasons."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I continue working while my appeal is pending?",
          a: "No. Filing a motion or appeal does not extend your work authorization or status. If your H-1B was denied while you were in H-1B status, you lost authorization on the date of denial. You must stop working unless you have another valid work authorization (valid OPT, H-4 EAD, etc.). Working without authorization has serious immigration consequences."
        },
        {
          q: "I was denied for specialty occupation. Is my career over?",
          a: "No. Specialty occupation denials are frustrating but often overcome with better evidence. Key strategies include: expert opinion letters from professors in the field, detailed job descriptions showing degree-level complexity, industry surveys showing educational requirements, and professional association statements. Many specialty occupation denials are reversed with stronger documentation."
        },
        {
          q: "My employer doesn't want to appeal. What are my options?",
          a: "If your employer won't appeal, you have limited options as they are the petitioner. You could find a new employer willing to file a fresh petition (if you're cap-exempt or it's cap season). You might pursue alternative visas that don't require employer petition (O-1, EB-1A). Maintaining valid status while finding solutions is critical. Discuss with an immigration attorney about individual options."
        },
        {
          q: "How long do I have to leave the US after denial?",
          a: "There's no specific grace period after H-1B denial. Once denied, if you have no other valid status, you should depart promptly to avoid accumulating unlawful presence. Some people interpret the 60-day grace period rule to apply, but this is for termination of employment, not denial of extension. Consult an attorney immediately to assess your specific situation and options."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I reapply for H-1B after denial?",
          a: "Yes, you can file a new H-1B petition. If you're cap-subject, you'll need to go through the lottery again for a new fiscal year unless you're filing an amendment or extension of previously granted H-1B status. Address all reasons for the previous denial in the new petition. Using a different employer may help if employer-related issues caused the denial."
