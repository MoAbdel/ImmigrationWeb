          content: "Syrian refugees resettled in the United States have specific work authorization rights that enable them to begin employment quickly. Understanding these rights is essential for Syrian families in Corona seeking financial stability and independence.\n\nUpon arrival in the United States, Syrian refugees are granted immediate work authorization through their refugee status. Your Form I-94 arrival record, stamped with your refugee admission, serves as proof of your right to work. However, most employers prefer to see an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), which provides a more recognizable form of work authorization.\n\nThe refugee work authorization system is designed to help you achieve self-sufficiency quickly. Unlike other immigration categories that may require waiting periods, refugees can begin working immediately upon arrival. This policy recognizes that employment is crucial for refugee families to establish themselves in their new communities like Corona."

          q: "Can Syrian refugees work immediately upon arrival in Corona?",
          a: "Yes, Syrian refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program can work immediately. Your I-94 with refugee admission stamp serves as initial proof of work authorization. However, we recommend applying for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) as most employers prefer this document for I-9 verification. There is no filing fee for refugees applying for an EAD."
        },
        {
          q: "How long does it take to get an EAD card for Syrian refugees?",
          a: "EAD processing for refugees typically takes 3-5 months from the date USCIS receives your application. You can track your case status online using your receipt number. While waiting, you can work using your I-94 and refugee admission stamp. We recommend filing early and renewing 6 months before expiration to avoid any gaps in work authorization."
        },
        {
          q: "Will my Syrian university degree be recognized by employers in Corona?",
          a: "Employers and licensing boards typically require credential evaluation to understand Syrian degrees. Organizations like WES, ECE, and SpanTran compare your Syrian education to U.S. equivalents. While some jobs may not require evaluation, professional positions and continuing education usually do. We can guide you through the evaluation process and help when original documents are unavailable due to the conflict."
        },
        {
          q: "What jobs are available for Syrian refugees in Corona with limited English?",
          a: "Corona offers many positions suitable for workers developing English skills. Warehouse and logistics jobs in the area often prioritize reliability over language. Manufacturing, food production, construction, cleaning services, and kitchen positions may have less English requirement. However, improving English significantly expands your opportunities and earning potential. Free ESL classes are available throughout the area."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I start my own business as a Syrian refugee in Corona?",
          a: "Yes, refugees with work authorization can start businesses in the United States. You can register a business while holding refugee status or after receiving your green card. Corona requires a business license, and you'll need a federal EIN for taxes. Resources like the Small Business Development Center and SCORE provide free guidance. Microloans through Kiva and Accion help refugees with limited credit history."
        },
        {
          q: "What free job training is available for Syrian refugees near Corona?",
          a: "Several free or low-cost training programs serve Corona residents. Riverside County Workforce Development offers free computer and job skills training. Community colleges like Norco College provide affordable vocational programs. The IRC and Catholic Charities offer refugee-specific job training. Healthcare certifications like CNA and forklift training have short timelines and lead to immediate employment opportunities."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need to renew my EAD after getting a green card?",
          a: "No, once you receive your green card through adjustment of status, you no longer need an EAD. Your green card serves as permanent work authorization. Refugees can apply for adjustment of status (green card) one year after arrival. We help Syrian refugees complete this important application to secure permanent residence and work authorization."
        },
        {
          q: "What should I do if an employer discriminates against me because I'm Syrian?",
          a: "Workplace discrimination based on national origin is illegal under federal and California law. Document any incidents and report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). Inland Counties Legal Services provides free legal help for employment discrimination. Your refugee or work permit status does not reduce your workplace rights."

I-94 الخاص بك مع ختم قبول اللاجئ يعمل كدليل أولي على تصريح العمل. ومع ذلك، نوصي بالتقدم للحصول على وثيقة تصريح العمل (EAD) حيث يفضل معظم أصحاب العمل هذه الوثيقة للتحقق من I-9. لا رسوم تقديم للاجئين المتقدمين لـ EAD."
