          a: "For U.S. citizens petitioning for parents (immediate relatives), the total process typically takes 12-24 months. This includes USCIS processing (12-18 months), NVC processing (2-4 months), and consular interview scheduling (1-3 months). We work to minimize delays through proper document preparation."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I petition for both my mother and father at the same time?",
          a: "Yes, you can file separate I-130 petitions for each parent simultaneously. Each parent requires their own petition and filing fee. If your parents are still married, their cases will typically be processed together."
        },
        {
          q: "What if my parent doesn't have a birth certificate?",
          a: "Many Arab countries have document challenges.

Our team has extensive experience with documents from Middle Eastern countries."

        {
          q: "Can my elderly parent get a medical waiver for vaccinations?",
          a: "Yes, elderly parents may qualify for vaccination waivers based on medical contraindications. A civil surgeon can document why certain vaccinations are not appropriate for your parent's age or health condition. We guide families through this process."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need a joint sponsor if my income is below the requirement?",
          a: "Yes, if your income doesn't meet 125% of the poverty guidelines for your household size, you'll need a joint sponsor. The joint sponsor must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident who can independently meet the income requirements. Many families use siblings or other relatives as joint sponsors."
        },
        {
          q: "Can my parent work after arriving in the United States?",
          a: "Yes, your parent will receive a green card upon arrival (or through adjustment of status) and will be immediately authorized to work in the United States. However, many elderly parents choose not to work and instead focus on family."
        },
        {
          q: "What if my parent previously overstayed a visa?",
          a: "Prior visa overstays can complicate immigration, but as an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen, your parent may still be eligible. Depending on the circumstances, a waiver may be required. We evaluate each situation individually and advise on the best approach."
