USCIS may find you misrepresented your intent. However, if circumstances changed after arrival (you decided to study after arriving), this is generally acceptable.\n\n*30/60 Day Rule:*\nIf you apply to change status within 30 days of arrival, there is a presumption you misrepresented your intent. Between 30-60 days, this presumption is weaker. After 60 days, changed intent is more believable.\n\n*School Enrollment:*\nSome schools will allow you to begin classes while your change of status is pending. Others require approved F-1 status first. Check with your school.\n\n**Documents Needed:**\n- Form I-539\n- Form I-20 from school\n- Financial evidence\n- Passport copies\n- I-94 record\n- Application fee",

          a: "Yes, in many cases. You can file Form I-539 to change from B-2 to F-1 status while remaining in the United States. You need to be accepted by a SEVP-certified school, have an I-20, and file while still in valid B-2 status.

There is no premium processing available for I-539. You can check current processing times on the USCIS website and monitor your case status online."

          q: "What happens if my I-539 is denied?",
          a: "If your I-539 is denied, you typically need to leave the United States. The denial notice will explain the reasons.

Consult an immigration professional before traveling."

        {
          q: "How early should I file the I-539?",
          a: "USCIS recommends filing at least 45 days before your current status expires. However, given long processing times, filing earlier is advisable when possible. You must file before your status expires - filing after your I-94 end date will likely result in denial and may create unlawful presence."
        },
        {
          q: "What is the 30/60 day rule for change of status?",
          a: "If you apply to change status within 30 days of entering the U.S., USCIS presumes you misrepresented your intent when you entered. Between 30-60 days, this presumption is weaker. After 60 days, it is easier to show that circumstances changed after arrival. This is particularly important for B-2 to F-1 changes."

          q: "Do I need a new visa stamp after I-539 approval?",
          a: "The I-539 changes your status in the U.S. but does not change the visa stamp in your passport. If you travel abroad and want to return, you will need to apply for a new visa in your new status category at a U.S. consulate. Your old visa stamp is not valid for re-entry in the new status."
